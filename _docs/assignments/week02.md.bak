# 2. Project management

I am 32 years old. This was the first time I programmed in real use (not just a standarized homework of "hellow world", but seriously for writing documentation of the whole Fablab session).  

Also, during COVID, I started everything online remotely, and had to get used to not only the programming or engineering knowledge, but also the entire Fablab logistics and criteria including the communication styles in local Oulu branch. Since my initial incentive is to experience maker education ethnographically, I had no face to lose, nor need I do things in a hurry as long as I do not give up.  

Thus, I officially started the session with zero knowledge on Jan 11 2022, and returned to construct the documentation on Mar 9, 2022, after 10 weeks of constant practice and exploration through some real project managements such as computer-aided design, computer-controlled cutting, intellectual property, electronics productions.
