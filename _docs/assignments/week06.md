# 6. 3D Scanning and printing

I think most of the students cannot resist the 3D printing skills, just like laser cutting. People can use designing software such as Fusion360 to design, modify 3D objects, then test and produce customised things. In this regard, it is a good example of maker education. 

This week's assignments consisted of group work and individual work. 

## Group Assignment  

For the group work, Behnaz instructed Antti Palosaari and me to inspect 3 different types of 3D printers. The puroose of the team work was to understand the key factors or features by the printers that influence the quality of 3D printing. We used the 3 device with 2 nozzle sizes to look at 8 nozzle filamnets. Antti is a great teammate:)   

The three devices we tested are:  
1. Formlabs Form 3+  
2. Stratasys Fortus 380mc  
3. Raise3D Pro2  

The nozzle sizes:  
1. 0.4mm  
2. 0.8mm  

The 8 filaments (or features) we tested:  
1. overhang  
2. overhang angle  
3. clearance  
4. birdge/span  
5. wall thickness  
6. gap  
7. dimension  
8. surface

### General test results

After our test, we agreed that Raise 3D Pro2 with 0.4 mm nozzle worked the best in terms of 3D printing quality and time cost.

Fortus with 0.4 mm nozzle worked ok but the clearance is not as good as the Raise 3D Pro2 with 0.4 mm.

Raise 3D Pro2 with 0.4 mm nozzle seemed to be funny as the 0.8 mm nozzle made 3D printing like topping the cream on a cake.  

Below is the summary of the test results.

Thus, we determined the **Raise 3D Pro2 with 0.4 mm** the best if we intend to make individual 3D printing. Unless with specific purpose, we would better not use the 0.8 mm nozzle.
