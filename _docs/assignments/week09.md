# 9. Embedded programming  

With the basic knowledge of PCB and soldering, this week I continued the electronics courses taught by Antti MÃ¤ntyniemi for embedded programming. I guess this is the foundation for Input design.  

This time the course is a typical engineering style: use a professional software (KiCad) to design the work, then realise it with computer-controlled machine (LPKF ProtoMat S62).  

## Research

### The use of fablab treasure box  

One of the most important things for independent study is to find the right resources. Antti used the [Fablab course material website](https://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/) which I found significant as I can find all necessary stuff recognised by Fablab.

### Some basic or updated knowledge  

#### the terms  

- **embedded programming**  

- **pin**: the "leg" of electric components.   

- **capacitor**: It can store electrical energy from some resources like battery. The difference is that, batteries store energy chemically, while capacitors realise it physically.  

- **GND**: abbreviation for "ground", which serves to be a common return path for electric current.  

#### The relation between PCB and electronic schematic  

PCB stands for printed circuit board. The board is a physical representation of schematic that can be understood as the "logic" or "soul" of the board.
