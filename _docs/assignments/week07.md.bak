# 7. Electronics Production

Antti Mäntyniemi kindly used reciprocal teaching and maker education to let an absolute beginner not afraid of gettting started to learn the electronics.

## How to get a PCB

### Stage 1 Background knowledge for absolute beginners
- **What is a PCB? What is it used for?** 

This sounds like a stupid question for engineering students, but it is still a basic question like "What is scaffolding" to outsiders of pedagogy, or "disenchantment" to sociology starters.  

So, **PCB(printed circuit board)** looks like below. 
![](../images/pcb1.34.jpg)  

PCB industry started at the beginning of the 20th century. Bofore that, elctronic circuits were directly connected to each other in a point-to-point way, installed on a chassis. The circuits were heavy, large, bulky and expensive. From 1903, inventors including Albert Hanson, Thomas Edison, and Arthur Berry discovered that they could laminate flat copper layers (or *foil*) on an insulating board, where conductors could be plated.  

The lines on the PCB board are called **circuit traces** or **tracks**. They can allow electricity to go through the **components** where programmes are installed.  

However, if it is a fresh board waiting to be used, like what I learned in the first week, it can be called a **PWB**(printed wiring board).

In the following part, there are more key terms to keep in mind.  

- **Machine.** The machine for the PCB milling in FabLab Oulu is Roland SRM-20. Of course, you have to set up parameters and run the machine from the connected desktop.

- **Drill**  

Drill literally means to dig a whole through a surface. In pedagogy, "drill" is interpreted as practice.  

Antti Mäntyniemi started the introduction by asking me whether I know 3D printing. I said no.  

Then, he asked if I know x, y, z axis in spatial design. I said yes.  

Now it is easy to understand: **drilling in electronics design means to move the machine tool up and down vertically.**  

![the tools of the drill](../images/pcb1.36.jpg)

That is why drill deals with **z** axis. 

- **Mill**  

Mill is not to make a house to grind grains into flour. In electronics design, mill means to move the tool **horizonally**, hence **x and y axis** are used.  


- **rectangular-bit or v-bit.**  

When drilling and milling the PCB plate, the machine will use **bit** to realize the task. The 2 most frequently used bits are rectangular and V-shape (as below).  
 
![](../images/pcb1.1.jpg)  

When the PCB plate is perfectly flat, the rectangular bit leaves a milled track with the width to be 0.4mm, while the V-bit, depending on how deep it drills into the copper foil, makes the width ranging from 0.2-0.5 mm.  

When the PCB plate is curved, both bit shapes can create irregular milled tracks.  

It is quite abstract to talk about 0.2-0.5mm. So I used the vernier caliper to visualize the parameters.

In FabLab Oulu, the most commonly used bits are rectangular style as below.

- **PCB blank.** The raw PCB working plate is called PCB blank. It has two layers. The lower part is a 1.6 mm plate; the upper surface is a 35μm copper foil (*1 mm = 1,000 μm).

<span style="color:blue">The PCB format I made this time was UPDI format. </span>


- **Sacrificial MDF bed.** This is a thick plate to hold the PCB working plate. MDF is a common choice. This sacrificial bed surface needs to be polished and engraved after worn out.
![](../images/pcb1.37.jpg)  

It is very important to know the thickness of PCB plate (e.g., in my assignment the thickness is **1.635mm**.) because if you set the drill tool into the bed and mill, **the tool can be easily broken.**  
 
- **Isolation cutting**  


### Stage 2  

In Stage 2, I will introduce how to initiate PCB traces (the body part) and outline (the shape) on https://mods.cba.mit.edu/.  

It looks quite scary as below, but I marked the 6 main stepss to click and ignore at the same time.  

![](../images/pcb1.4.jpg)  

The purpose of the big picture is to set the necessary parameters including the size of the PCB, the milling (peeling) parts, the width and depth of traces.  

https://mods.cba.mit.edu/ allows FabLab Oulu users to set up parameters remotely through the big map above.  

What I did was to go to the website → right click the mouse → choose programm → choose open server program → choose Roland PCB svg (the final file format is .svg).  

![](../images/pcb1.5.jpg)
![](../images/pcb1.6.jpg)
![](../images/pcb1.7.jpg)  

**step 1** delete the unnecessary window: the WebSocket device (press "delete").  

![](../images/pcb1.8.jpg)  

Instead, right click the mouse in the empty place → choose file: save → get the new window.  

![](../images/pcb1.9.jpg)  

connect the **outputs** with **inputs** → clcik  **move to origin**. The purpose is to generate a tool path that Roland milling machine can understand.  

![](../images/pcb1.10.jpg)  

**step 2** reset the x/y/z parameters in origin. 
![](../images/pcb1.11.jpg)  

**step 3** load the **traces** file to modify.  

First, Antti
