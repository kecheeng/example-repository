## How to get a PCB

### Stage 1 Background knowledge for absolute beginners
- **What is a PCB? What is it used for?** 

This sounds like a stupid question for engineering students, but it is still a basic question like "What is scaffolding" to outsiders of pedagogy, or "disenchantment" to sociology starters.  

So, **PCB(printed circuit board)** looks like below. 
![](../images/pcb1.34.jpg)  

PCB industry started at the beginning of the 20th century. Bofore that, elctronic circuits were directly connected to each other in a point-to-point way, installed on a chassis. The circuits were heavy, large, bulky and expensive. From 1903, inventors including Albert Hanson, Thomas Edison, and Arthur Berry discovered that they could laminate flat copper layers (or *foil*) on an insulating board, where conductors could be plated.  

The lines on the PCB board are called **circuit traces** or **tracks**. They can allow electricity to go through the **components** where programmes are installed.  

However, if it is a fresh board waiting to be used, like what I learned in the first week, it can be called a **PWB**(printed wiring board).

In the following part, there are more key terms to keep in mind.  

- **Machine.** The machine for the PCB milling in FabLab Oulu is Roland SRM-20. Of course, you have to set up parameters and run the machine from the connected desktop.

- **Drill**  

Drill literally means to dig a whole through a surface. In pedagogy, "drill" is interpreted as practice.  

Antti Mäntyniemi started the introduction by asking me whether I know 3D printing. I said no.  

Then, he asked if I know x, y, z axis in spatial design. I said yes.  

Now it is easy to understand: **drilling in electronics design means to move the machine tool up and down vertically.**  

![the tools of the drill](../images/pcb1.36.jpg)

That is why drill deals with **z** axis. 

- **Mill**  

Mill is not to make a house to grind grains into flour. In electronics design, mill means to move the tool **horizonally**, hence **x and y axis** are used.  


- **rectangular-bit or v-bit.**  

When drilling and milling the PCB plate, the machine will use **bit** to realize the task. The 2 most frequently used bits are rectangular and V-shape (as below).  
 
![](../images/pcb1.1.jpg)  

When the PCB plate is perfectly flat, the rectangular bit leaves a milled track with the width to be 0.4mm, while the V-bit, depending on how deep it drills into the copper foil, makes the width ranging from 0.2-0.5 mm.  

When the PCB plate is curved, both bit shapes can create irregular milled tracks.  

It is quite abstract to talk about 0.2-0.5mm. So I used the vernier caliper to visualize the parameters.  

![](../images/pcb1.3.jpg)

In FabLab Oulu, the most commonly used bits are rectangular style as below.
![the FabLab bit](../images/pcb1.27.jpg)  


- **PCB blank.** The raw PCB working plate is called PCB blank. It has two layers. The lower part is a 1.6 mm plate; the upper surface is a 35μm copper foil (*1 mm = 1,000 μm).  
![](../images/pcb1.2.jpg) 

<span style="color:blue">The PCB format I made this time was UPDI format. </span>


- **Sacrificial MDF bed.** This is a thick plate to hold the PCB working plate. MDF is a common choice. This sacrificial bed surface needs to be polished and engraved after worn out.
![](../images/pcb1.37.jpg)  

It is very important to know the thickness of PCB plate (e.g., in my assignment the thickness is **1.635mm**.) because if you set the drill tool into the bed and mill, **the tool can be easily broken.**  
 
- **Isolation cutting**  


### Stage 2  

In Stage 2, I will introduce how to set up two files to be milled: **PCB traces (the body part) and outline (the shape)** on https://mods.cba.mit.edu/.  

It looks quite scary at the first glance, but I marked the 6 main stepss to click and ignore at the same time.  

![](../images/pcb1.4.jpg)  

The purpose of the big picture is to set the necessary parameters including the size of the PCB, the milling (peeling) parts, the width and depth of traces.  

https://mods.cba.mit.edu/ allows FabLab Oulu users to set up parameters remotely through the big map above.  

What I did was to go to the website → right click the mouse → choose programm → choose open server program → choose Roland PCB svg (the final file format is .svg).  

![](../images/pcb1.5.jpg)
![](../images/pcb1.6.jpg)
![](../images/pcb1.7.jpg)  

**step 1** delete the unnecessary window: the WebSocket device (press "delete").  

![](../images/pcb1.8.jpg)  

Then, right click the mouse in the empty place → choose file: save → get a new window named **save file**. Just leave it there at the moment.  
  
![](../images/pcb1.9.jpg)  


**step 2** load 2 .svg file (PCB traces and outline)  
 

First, Antti gave me 2 pre-set **.svg** files for the PCB shape and body.  
![](../images/pcb1.12.jpg)  

The whole work generally consists of 2 sections: the traces/inner paths of PCB, and the outline or shape of the PCB (for example, in this work the shape is a regular USB).  


**step 3** Invert the .svg files.  

Look at the left upper corner of the whole map, select the **inner paths .SVG** file.  
![](../images/pcb1.13.jpg)  

In the right window, click **invert** to redefine the zone to be removed.  
<span style="color:green">It is important to remember that, in PCB milling setting, the black parts will be removed by the tools. The white parts are the copper layers that connnect the components via currents. So unlike vinyl cutting, you definetely don't want to make the PCB functions inverted. </span>  
![](../images/pcb1.14.jpg)  
![](../images/pcb1.15.jpg)  


**step 4** Set PCB default.  
Without special intention, usually you don't have to change anything. Usually, you will just go on.

**step 5** Set the mill raster 2D parameters.  
 
<span style="color:green">This is a key step to get the "millable" .rml files.</span> Since a milled PCB consists of the traces and an outline, there will be 2 .rml files which require you to **return from step 2 to step 5** to set up the outline svg file later.  
As you can see, the 2D mill file is basically a raster file which considers pixels rather than lines. The tool diameter determines the copper zones to be removed. The bigger the tool diameter is, the more copper surface will be removed. The cut depth defines how deep the tool will go into the board.  
![](../images/pcb1.16.jpg)  

Antti shared his experience of the three parameters: the diameter to be 0.3 mm; the cut depth as 0.07 mm (It is interesting as the thickness of copper layer is 35 μm (0.035 mm), so 0.07 mm doubles the thickness, allowing the 2 depth settings to be equal.  
![](../images/pcb1.17.jpg)  

Of course, you can also try different tool diameters. **Always keep in mind that the depth is critical especially when you have to set Roland machine by hand.**For instance, in this PCB board, the thickness is 1.635 mm, so you should limit the max depth to be reasonable. Otherwise, the tool may drill through the whole PCB board, breaking itself when conducting the milling work.  

![](../images/pcb1.21.jpg)  

After this, click **calculate** to get a redefined file which will be downloaded automatically.  

![](../images/pcb1.18.jpg)  

If you review the refined file, it shows the paths to be milled. The red arrows are the general sequences that the tool will go.  

 ![](../images/pcb1.19.jpg)  



**step 6** Finalize the setting.  

First, reset the x/y/z parameters in origin to be all 0.  

![](../images/pcb1.11.jpg) 

Then, click  **move to origin**. The purpose is to generate a tool path that Roland milling machine can understand.  

<span style="color:green">Also, rembmer to connect the **outputs** with **inputs** of step 1.</span>   

![](../images/pcb1.10.jpg)  



Now, **redo steps 3-6 to set up the milling work of the outline.**  

One imporant note: click the invert <span style="color:red">You definitely do not want the whole PCB work to be removed away, leaving only the empty shape. </span>  

After getting the two .rml files, Congratulations! I finished the PCB files setting.
