# 9. Embedded programming  

With the basic knowledge of PCB and soldering, this week I continued the electronics courses taught by Antti MÃ¤ntyniemi for embedded programming on a STDI chip. The learning objective is to produce a programmed STDI PCB board with an LED controlled by a button. The functions of LED and the button shall be programmmed. I guess this is the foundation for Input design.  

This time the course is a typical engineering style: use a professional software (KiCad) to design the work, then realise it with computer-controlled machine (LPKF ProtoMat S62).  

Based on the prior knowledg of PCB, Antti M used reverse engineering to teach. He made me observe a prototype of final PCB work, and guided me to think, disassemble the process of realisation backwards.    

## Research

### The use of fablab treasure box  

One of the most important things for independent study is to find the right resources. Antti used the [Fablab course material website](https://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/) which I found significant as I can find all necessary stuff recognised by Fablab.

### Some basic or updated knowledge  

#### the terms  

- **embedded programming**: to use microcontrollers as the savers for specific programming. For example, the reason why smartphones and electronic devices can be "smart" is that engineers programme certain functions and store them in the microcontrollers (usually known as chips) to allow users to interact.     

- **pin**: the "leg" of electric components.   

- **capacitor**: It can store electrical energy from some resources like battery. The difference is that, batteries store energy chemically, while capacitors realise it physically.  

- **GND**: abbreviation for "ground", which serves to be a common return path for electric current.  

#### The relation between PCB and electronic schematic  

PCB stands for printed circuit board. The board is a physical representation of schematic that can be understood as the "logic" or "soul" of the board. By programming the component functions in schematic, you can define the connections of the pins as well as the workflows of the PCB.

## Procedure

### Use KiCad to set 2 printable files  

For this step, we used **KiCad** as the software to design the schematic.

#### Set up the KiCad Libraries  

An important feature of embedded programming is that you do NOT have to scratch from the surface.   

#### Find proper Items(components)    

#### Draw lines to link the items   

#### Solve the rats' nest puzzles  

#### Tips for debugging  

#### Add a filled zone to the schematic  

#### Generate .gerber files

### Use ProtoMat S62 to mill it out
