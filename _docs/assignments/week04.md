# 4. Computer controlled cutting

This week Behnaz taught us how to use vinyl cutter and laser cutter. To get the svg file, the simplest way is to practise using Inkscape. This time, I had to force myself to use Fusion 360 to do parametric design before transfering it to an svg file.

vinyl cutting
Starting from a basic Inkscape pattern, it is a good habit to also draw a frame for the convenience of later weeding. Weeding, according to Neil's video, means peeling the unnecessary parts. Ctrl + Shift + R can allow me to resize page to drawing or selection in Document Properties.

To open or close the Roland vinyl cutter, push the handle at the left back side. Then, the two wheels can be lifted.

It is a must to place the vinyl paper between the two wheels. The wheels must also be within the white label ranges to be detectable by the machine.
