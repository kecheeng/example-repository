# 19. Invention, intellectual property and income

This week Megumi gave us basic ideas of patent, copyright, intellectual properties, and commercial values of our final projects. She also encouraged us to share our ideas or drafts of the final project, comment and give "3 star 1 wish" suggestions to help each other realize them. To me, even the final project may take longer time to achieve due to the changing agenda, it is meaningful to digest Neil's video and Megumi's knowledge in a practical scenario.

## Research

## What does my project draft look like?

## Any plan to start business with the project?

### Motivation

### Types

### Sources

### Funding


## Who are the target users?


## Which copyright licenses will I consider and choose? Why?


## How about the patent?
