# 2. Project management

This week, Ivan taught us how to use GIT as a version control system to store, modify and recall files in local repository to online repository. After well configured, an individual can easily manage projects alone or invite others to work together in cyber space.  

Howeve, I am 32 years old with no programming knowledge. This was the first time I programmed in real use(not just a standarized homework of "hello world", but seriously for writing documentation of the whole Fablab session). To be honest, it took me some time to realise why this programming was about project management.  

To finish the task, I installed Gitlab (failed to use due to the credit card verification), Github, GitCMD, Python, Mkdocs, all of which are freshly new to me. It means that I had to simultaneously learn and understand those computer sciences tools apart from the programming, the logic of VCS, as well as the non-stop courses from Fablab(all new).  

Also, during COVID, I started everything online remotely, and had to get used to not only the engineering knowledge, but also the entire Fablab logistics and criteria including the communication styles in local Oulu branch.  

Since my initial incentive is to experience maker education ethnographically, I have no face to lose, nor need I do things in a hurry as long as I do not give up.  

Thus, I officially started the session with zero knowledge on Jan 11 2022, but returned to construct the documentation on Mar 9, 2022, after 10 weeks of constant practice and exploration via real project managements such as computer-aided design, computer-controlled cutting, intellectual property, electronics productions.  

It is very useful as now I feel more practical and relatable to Ivan and Neil's teaching materials (video, ppt, etc).  

<span style="color:green">In this regard, I borrowed some of Ivan's ppt pictures for elaboration.</span>   
     
I particularly thank Ivan for the comprehensive introduction of the knowledge as well as his patience, Diep for encouragement, and Antti R for extended Markdown knowledge such as the localhost: 8000.  
 
## The exploration of GIT and Github  

### GIT, Gitlab & Github  

When people create some files, there will be several verions which are not always ready or perfect, so different audience or cooperators may want to refer to specific versions at certain points, or construct different work paths, respectively. Therefore, it is needed to have an "online bank of files", which is **Version Control System (VCS)**.

GIT is a fast, user-friendly, flexible VCS to allow users to **record** changes to a file or **recall** previous versions from it as it saves historical logs. Multiple users can thus work cooperatively on the shared files. There are a number of popular VCS while this time we chose GIT as practice.

There are also several popular GIT code hosting sites with the same syntax. The biggest difference between Gitlab and Github is that the previous one needs a credit card verification. Unfortunately, I was robbed so had to go through Github where I must type **mkdocs build** manually.

### The creation of a page on Github  

Basic knowledge for absolute beginners:  

<span style="color:yellow">First of all, a website is a text document. It is written in **html** syntax to allow **browsers** such as Chrome to read and display.</span>  

- **html** is about the content and structure of a webpage.  
- **CSS** is about the styles and designs (font, colour, size) of a webpage.  
- **Javascript** is about the interactive elements with users.  

Below is my first webpage using html sytanx.

On the other hand, just like academic terms, in computer sciences, there are also many CS words that need to know:  

- **configure**: create, install, establish.  
- **repository**: warehouse, storage, a saving place.  
- **local**: saved in your PC.  
- **remote**: saved online (in VCS).  
- **push**: upload files from local repository to the online repository.  
- **pull**: the reversed flow of push.  

### The management of local and remote repositories  


## My personal website and Markdown exploration

### Use static site generator to construct a personal site  

**Template** saves a lot of time for site builders as the html, CSS, and Javascript contents have been preset. You need to understand the basic logics and syntax of those parts to "fork your own" site by changing details.   

### The toolbox for site modification: Markdown syntax  

Let's have a direct comparision between html and markdown grammars.

Apparently, markdown is much easier to learn and use. It does not require users to memorise very detailed syntax, but can pay more attention on the content writing.  Of course, if you are an expert in html syntax, or want to debug very specific parts, or write more customised sites, it is rewarding to probe into html.  

### Mkdocs: A great project documentation tool  

In the **_docs** files, a user uses markdown syntax to build up a site. <span style="color:red">To transfer the contents into html format, you must use **mkdocs** commands.</span>
