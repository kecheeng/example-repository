Antti MÃ¤ntyniemi kindly used reciprocal teaching and maker education to let an absolute beginner not afraid of gettting started to learn the electronics.

## How to get a PCB

### Stage 1 Background knowledge for absolute beginners
- **What is a PCB? What is it used for?** 

This sounds like a stupid question for engineering students, but it is still a basic question like "What is scaffolding" to outsiders of pedagogy, or "disenchantment" to sociology starters.  

So, **PCB(printed circuit board)** looks like below.

PCB industry started at the beginning of the 20th century. Bofore that, elctronic circuits were directly connected to each other in a point-to-point way, installed on a chassis. The circuits were heavy, large, bulky and expensive. From 1903, inventors including Albert Hanson, Thomas Edison, and Arthur Berry discovered that they could laminate flat copper layers (or *foil*) on an insulating board, where conductors could be plated.  

The lines on the PCB board are called **circuit traces** or **tracks**. They can allow electricity to go through the **components** where programmes are installed.  

However, if it is a fresh board waiting to be used, like what I learned in the first week, it can be called a **PWB**(printed wiring board).
