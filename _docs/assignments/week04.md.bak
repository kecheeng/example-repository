# 4. Computer controlled cutting

This week Behnaz taught us how to use vinyl cutter and laser cutter. To get a svg file, the simplest way is to practise using Inkscape. This time, I had to force myself to use Fusion 360 to do parametric design before transfering it to an svg file. Fusion 360 is inescapable as Inkscape is powerful only except for parametric design. 


## Research
First key notion to keep in mind: raster-for engraving, which is about dots, pixels; vector-for cutting, which is about lines, flames (as more beam power is focused).
The toughest part was the usage of fusion360. At first, I was afraid of the new, professional software but with the encouragement from Antti, Diep, and Behnaz, I calmed down, watched Neil's intro video, youtube tutorials, and some Chinese geeks' clips. After a good sleep, I opened fusion360, randomly drew a pentagon, tried some constraints, clicked here and there to explore the parameter setting window before it accidentally worked! The same feeling took place again, which was just like those for Github programming as well as Inkscape. I could literally feel the convenience of parametric design and the reason to use it over Inkscape. Mentally, it proved learning curve again: For me, Inkscape-5 days; Github programming-12 days; Fusion360-7 days.

### observation and practice 
Starting from a basic Inkscape pattern, it is a good habit to also draw a frame for the convenience of later weeding. Weeding, according to Neil's video, means peeling the unnecessary parts. Ctrl + Shift + R can allow me to resize page to drawing or selection in Document Properties.

To open or close the Roland vinyl cutter, push the handle at the left back side. Then, the two wheels can be lifted.

It is a must to place the vinyl paper between the two wheels. The wheels must also be within the white label ranges in order to be detectable by the machine.

If you want to get a more precise measurement of the vinyl paper, you can press preference in printing window, then click "Get from Machine". This allows the scanner of the vinyl cutter to horizontally run across the vinyl paper.

To transfer the svg file to Roland vinyl cutter, find Roland CutStudio in Extensions, then press "Open".

It is advisable to select "Edge" in Sheet category.

Here we go. A note: the size of the vinyl paper should be moderate. Avoid thin one. Importantly, the most obvious difference between vinyl and laser cutter is that vinyl cutter literally uses sharp knife to press on the material to get the lines.

The most standarized way to weed (peel) the usable sticker is to use tweezer, especially when there are exquisite spots or lines. Of course, if they were just basic patterns, or to make the lessons more attractive to youngsters, fingers and hands are parallelly flexible tools.

Transferring sheets are powerful if you want to save the cut work for later use. The tough side of vinyl paper is slippery, allowing transferring sheet to attach them tightly. After this procedure, you can get both the stikers and transferring sheets to show the sticky sides. Be careful of the dusts, of course.

The end of observation and practice session. Quite straightforward experience. The frame is an important part to allow convenient weeding. Also, it helps to justify positive and negative patterns as later I encountered when doing my own giant panda printing practice.

### self design and final work
Without much talk, I got a panda bear svg file from the Internet, added a frame in Inkscape, exported it to Roland Cutstudio, made 3 sizes, then set up the cutter (mode: edge) as in the observation session.

I used black vinyl as panda bear fur is a combination of white and black.

When it came to weeding (peeling), Diep asked about how to define which parts to leave. To be honest, I had the same concern the day before. My friend who knows seal cutting comforted me that it is my justification of positive and negative effects. Therefore, you can see that on the left side, the little pattern was the residual that I didnt need simply because I knew the color distribution of panda. Also, as you can see, the larger the sticker is (mine largest size was 70mm), the easier to weed and to allow more complicated line designs.

After weeding, I got the stickers I needed. How to transfer them? Transfering sheet was helpful. Press it hard to the work, lift then get the usable stickers. Be careful since the panda show their skicky sides to me.

The final work looks great. The sticky side was quite strong. Also, the rough side seems durable.

### self design and final work
In week's three's fusion360 tiral, I drew a pentagon with slots. In this week's laser cutting, I thought things would be quite easy and straightforward with several steps like drawing, printing and analysing. However, I was so naive that the first step of this week was problematic, which ultimately made me refine and reflect on the trouble that I wanted to dodge. In the picture below, I found it a bit strange with unconnected lines.
![](../images/f360eplp1.jpg)

I clicked the drawing view settings and found that the lines were connected if I changed the scale in to 1:2. Then I happily exported it into pdf format.
![](../images/f360eplp2.jpg)

When I inspected the pdf file in Inkscape, I found the problem: ok, everything was shrunk into half size including the slot. Apparently, I could not use a slot with 1.5 mm in MDF.
![](../images/f360eplp3.jpg)

As time was very limited, I needed to hand in some tentative assignments on time, I directly used Inkscape to close the 1:1 scale pentagon lines through drawing.
![](../images/f360eplp4.jpg)

Then, I selected all the lines to set the width to be 0.02 mm for laser cutting (not graving).
![](../images/f360eplp5.jpg)

I observed that the laser cutting work ran twice: first to cut the unconnected lines, then pinpointedly cut the modified parts from Inkscape, which proved its smartness in 2D design. 
![](../images/f360eplp6.jpg)

I duplicated the pentagon to get 5 extra pieces.
![](../images/f360eplp7.jpg)

After waiting for 1 minute, I took out the pieces. Before playiny, I used the vernier caliper to measure the side and slot. The results were satisfactory: side-53mm; slotwidth-0.3mm (0.1mm's credit for kerf).
![](../images/f360eplp8.jpg)
![](../images/f360eplp9.jpg)

Finally I could play the pieces by putting them together. It looked stable and nice.
![](../images/f360eplp10.jpg)

I particularly checked the interlocking part: since the slothdepth was 0.5 mm, the total interlock depth was 1.0 mm. It was fairly stable, but would be better If I made the slotwidth deeper, say, 1 mm. Also, the nodes and other interlocking designs are all worth exploring. 
As for the function, pentagon looks elegant, so I would use Inkscape to draw some patterns or pictures and use it as a badge. The wizard card in Harry Potter is a good example.

I thought it was over until I showed my concern of the unconnected lines in the drawing. Behnaz explained how the function of extrude works, which opened a great DLC of the week's project and occupied all my free time in 2022 lunar new year.
