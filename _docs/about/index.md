# About me

![](../images/avatar-photo.jpg)

Hi! I am Kecheng Zhang. I come from China. I am a master student of Learning, Education and Technology in the University of Oulu. I like to play RPGs, do free reading, experiencing and creating interesting things. 
However, I don't like cooking.

## My background

I was born in Chengdu, the hometown of panda bears, the hot pot, and spicy Sichuan Chinese food. 

## Previous work

I was a teacher, and hope to continue to work in education field with broader understanding of education, as well as more technologies. This is my first time programming.

### Final Project

In the final project, I hope to design and realize a Finnish winter wooden handbag or a schoolbag. 
Finnish winter is cold and dark. People need to hang small lights or reflective bandages to their clothes or bagpacks to remind drivers.
In my project, I hope to use laser cutter to make the main body of the wooden bag. I will engrave some holes at certain sides of the wood bag, allowing to insert LED lights controlled by electronic sensors.
One of the challenging parts is to bend the back + head + front side. 
Of course, this bag needs to have a balance between functionality and fashion.
