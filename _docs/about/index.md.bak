# About me

Hi! I am Kecheng Zhang from China. I am a master student of Learning, Education and Technology in the University of Oulu. I like to play RPGs, do free reading, experiencing and creating interesting things. However, I don't like cooking.


## My background

I was born in Chengdu, the hometown of giant panda bears, the hot pot, and spicy Sichuan Chinese food. Located in southwest China, it is the regional metropolis with over 20 million population. Away from stereotypical Confucianism, people prefer a relaxing, humorous life, just like its mild climate (only 300 cloudy days a year), the outdoor teahouse, misty bamboo forests, and Taoist ideology.

## Previous work

I was a trained teacher for high school and K-12 education, and hope to continue to work in this field with a broader understanding of education, as well as more technologies. This is my first time programming.

### Final Project

In the final project, I hope to design and realize a wooden handbag or a schoolbag used for Finnish winter. 
Finnish winter is cold and dark. People need to hang small lights or reflective bandages to their clothes or bagpacks to remind drivers.
In my project, I hope to use laser cutter to get the main body of the wooden bag. I will engrave some holes at certain sides of the wood bag, allowing to insert LED lights controlled by electronic sensors.
One of the challenging parts is to bend the back + head + front side. 
Meanwhile, this bag needs to have a balance between functionality and fashion.
