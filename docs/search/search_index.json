Project management \u00b6 This week, Ivan taught us how to use GIT as a version control system to store, modify and recall files in local repository to online repository. After well configured, an individual can easily manage projects alone or invite others to work together in cyber space. Reflection \u00b6 I am 32 years old with literally no programming knowledge. This was the first time I programmed in real use(not just a standarized exercise of \u201chello world\u201d, but seriously for writing documentation of the whole Fablab session). To be honest, it took me some time to realise why this programming was about project management. To finish the task, I installed Gitlab (failed to use due to the credit card verification), Github, GitCMD, Python, Mkdocs, all of which were fresh to me. It means that I had to simultaneously learn and understand those computer sciences tools apart from the programming, the logic of VCS, GIT, the workflow of each command, as well as the non-stop courses from Fablab(all new). Also, during COVID, I started everything online, and had to get used to not only the engineering knowledge, but also the entire Fablab logistics and criteria including the communication styles in local Oulu branch. Since my initial incentive is to experience maker education ethnographically, I have no face to lose, nor need I do things in a hurry as long as I do not give up. It is a process of problem solving . Thus, I officially began the session with zero knowledge on Jan 11 2022, but returned to construct the documentation on Mar 9, 2022, after 10 weeks of constant practice and exploration via real project managements such as computer-aided design, computer-controlled cutting, intellectual property, electronics productions. It is very useful as now I feel more practical and relatable to Ivan and Neil\u2019s teaching materials (video, ppt, etc). In this regard, I borrowed some of Ivan\u2019s ppt pictures for elaboration. Even so, I spent another 3 weeks digesting and understanding the logical steps. I particularly thank Ivan for his comprehensive introduction of the knowledge as well as patience, Diep for encouragement, and Antti R for extended Markdown knowledge such as the localhost: 8000. Things to install when using Github: CMD (can use Git CMD) : to run commands Notepad++ : to write markdown or html syntax Github (register a personal account) : to host webpages on VCS Python : to run mkdocs mkdocs : to transcribe markdown codes to html format GIT \u00b6 VCS, GIT, Gitlab & Github \u00b6 When people create files, there will be several verions which are not always ready or perfect, while different audience or cooperators may refer specific versions at certain points, or construct different work paths, respectively. Therefore, it is needed to have an \u201conline bank of files\u201d, which is Version Control System (VCS) . GIT is a fast, user-friendly, flexible VCS to allow users to record changes to a file, or recall previous versions from as it saves historical logs. Multiple users can thus work cooperatively on the shared files. There are a number of popular VCS while this time we chose GIT as practice. There are also several popular GIT code hosting sites with the same syntax. The biggest difference between Gitlab and Github is that the previous one needs a credit card verification. Most people prefer to use Gitlab as it supports mkdocs which can transcribe Markdown into html language remotely . Unfortunately, I was robbed so had to register a Github account where I must type mkdocs build every time manually on PC as it does not support mkdocs. Creating a page \u00b6 Basic knowledge for absolute beginners: First of all, a website is a text document. It is written in html syntax to allow browsers such as Chrome to read and display. A modern webpage usually consists of three parts: html is about the content (the uploaded text, pictures, videos) and structure of a webpage, which is shown as index . CSS is about the styles and design elements (font, colour, size) of a webpage. Javascript is about the interactive elements (toggles, pop-up windows, menus) with users. Below is my first webpage using html sytanx. On the other hand, just like academic terms, in computer sciences, there are also many CS words that need to know: configure : create, install, establish. directory : file. repository : warehouse, storage, a saving place. local : saved in your PC. remote : saved online (in VCS). push : upload files from local repository to the online repository. pull : the reversed flow of push. deploy : show, run, display. Now, I need to push my webpage to Github. In common language, we can say to post it online. Key commands in GIT \u00b6 git status : Check if there are updated files in the local repository. git add . : Track the updated files and prepare them to be commited. You can also add xxx(specific files, remember to have the \u201cfull name.format\u201d typing) to add specific files. git commit -m \u201cxxx\u201d : Store the added files to the local repository. \u201cxxx\u201d is a note or label. git push : Synchronise the files stored in local repository to remote counterpart. After this step, the locally saved files will be moved to the GIT repository. In fact, you can type \u201cgit \u2013help\u201d to find basic commands. Antti R taught me a very useful code to preview the webpage locally by typying \u201c mkdocs serve \u201d then open a window with the command \u201c localhost:8000 \u201d. Every time I save something on notepad, the localhost will be refreshed immediately to allow checking and proofreading. To close it, press Ctrl + C . Description of the website \u00b6 It is crucial to know the learning objectives throughout the process. The goal was not to become an html expert, but to generate a documentation page for project management. Thus, I did not want to use the \u201chello world\u201d as my website, but looked for some templates . Template \u00b6 Template saves plenty of time from scratching the surface of website construction as the html, CSS, and Javascript contents have been preset. You need to understand the basic logics and syntax of those parts to \u201cfork your own\u201d site by changing details. Bootstrap, Wrap Boostrap , and Start Bootstrap are popular template websites. For Fablab assignment, this time I adopted Ivan\u2019s Fablab student template. In fact, if something can be a template, it must contain some brilliant ideas. You can right click the mouse on any webpage, or press F12, to open the \u201cbackstage\u201d to see how specific codes and syntax effects the display of the text, which is good for active learners. However, you should pay attention to intellectual property issues when you want to \u201cborrow\u201d something from others\u2019 webpage. Now, I needed to host the personal webpage to Github. Step 1 Open CMD , type git config user.name \u201cxxx\u201d , and git config user.email \u201cxxx@xxx\u201d to create a name and email address at GIT repository. Step 2 git config \u2013global user.email \u201cxxx\u201d to make your username and email the same for all repositories at your GIT. SSH \u00b6 SSH can be understood as keys to the GIT servers. Every time if someone (including the original creator) wants to upload or modify something from local repository, the server will check if the keys are matched. There are public and private keys. The public one can be shared to anyone for collaborative work, while the private one should be only stored in local PC. You do no create the key on your own, but rather type ssh-keygen -t rsa -C \u201cyour.email@example.com\u201d -b 4096 to create a long chain based on cryptology. Go to home directory to find .ssh file. The _id_rsa is the private key. You can open it with a notepad (but don\u2019t share). If you redo the ssh-keygen code, it means that the computer will randomly create a new pair of SSH. If you click y to overwrite the SSH, new public & private keys will replace the _id_rsa files, so remember to copy & paste the new public key to the GIT. Otherwise, your new push will be denied as the public SSH is unmatched. Creating the site \u00b6 Step 1 I used Ivan\u2019s Fablab student webpage template from his Github page. I downloaded the compressed zip file from Moodle. Step 2 In CMD, I typed \u201cmkdir example website github\u201d to configure my local repository for Github. Step 3 In CMD, I typed \u201cgit init\u201d to create a local repository. Then, I went to the downloaded student template file, cut and pasted all the files to my Github local repository. I deleted 2 unnecesary files: .gitlab-ci.yml and requirements.txt. Step 4 I created a remote repository to \u201creceive\u201d the uploaded files from local repository. Then, in the remote repository, I clicked Setting - Pages , made sure the Branch to be master . You can see the information of \u201cYour site is published at:.....\u201d as the ultimately webpage. It takes some time to refresh so do not worry. Step 5 Then, I went to CMD, did the following 4 steps to push the files saved at _docs folder to remote repository. Then, in CMD I typed git remote add origin git@github.com:kecheeng/example-repository.git to generate a link between my local and remote repositories. Everytime if I use git push, the data can be correctly pushed to this remote repository. It needs SSH key so again shows the necessity of creating SSH keys. Now, type git remote and git push , which allow me to push the webpage to remote repository. Finally, I can host the personal page at Github. Step 6 Fork my personal information based on the student template. To do so, open mkdocs.yml at the local repository with notepad++. mkdocs.yml allows me to define the name of the site, the descriptions, social media links, colors, fonts, etc . In this regard, I practised changing the title, adding a dark mode, the new colour of the webpage for spring, and customizing my social media information. Use Markdown to easily write syntax Interestingly, it took me weeks to realise that I had been using markdown language rather than html on notepad to modify personal webpage. Why markdown is recommended? Let\u2019s have a direct comparision between markdown & html grammar. Apparently, markdown is much easier to learn and use. Using plain text, it does not require users to memorise very detailed syntax, but can pay more attention on the content construction. Markdown reads codes from top-down, which is a vertical flow, so it omits the complicated layout setting. Of course, if you are an expert in html syntax, or want to debug very specific parts, or write more customised sites, it is rewarding to probe into html. Below are my frequently used markdown syntax: **xxx**(2 dots on each side): make the text bold . *xxx*(1 dot on each side): make the text in italics . ***: create a horizonal line. <span style=\u201dcolor:green\u201d> text </span>: colour specific text . ![](): attach a file such as pictures to the webpage. [xxx](): create a hyperlink to allow readers to click it and open a file in another window. - : create a bullet. In fact, the syntax in notepad is as below. There are two important tips for to escape the syntax characters: type \\ before the sensitive characters use hex for some characters Of course, there are many interesting markdown syntax from the cheatsheet worth exploring.(https://cheatography.com/snidd111/cheat-sheets/gitlab-markdown/) Step 7 _docs \u2192 Mkdocs \u2192 docs Basically, in this step, I used Mkdocs as a Static Site Generator written in Python to transcribe other computer language, source code, and characters into html that can be deployed as a website . Gitlab can directly execute mkdocs in the serve, whereas Github does not. Therefore, I have to type mkdocs mannually each time. After customizing my own information, under Github, I MUST change the doc into _doc . Then, create an empty file named doc . In _docs folder I store and modify files in different folders, using markdown as source code. I put pictures and videos into images , and write documentations in assignments . In docs folder I store the html source code built by mkdocs . This is page that is deployed and shown ultimately. If I examine the mkdocs.yml file, I can see that docs_dir represents _docs folder , whereas site_dir for docs folder . In the _docs files, a user usually employs markdown syntax to upload & modify files to a webpage. To transcribe the contents into html format in docs file, you must use mkdocs commands. To realize it, install two things accordingly: Python(Don\u2019t be scared) MkDocs (type pip install mkdocs in CMD to install it. Mkdocs is monitored by Python). So, every time after modifying things in _doc , run the 4 steps ( git status, git add ., git commit -m \u201cxxx\u201d, git push) to store files in markdown . Then, I should type mkdocs build to transcribe markdown into html saved in docs . Finally, redo git status, git add ., git commit -m \u201cxxx\u201d, git push to synchronize the deployed website remotely.","title":"2.

Computer Aided Design \u00b6 This week (In the middle of January) Yrj\u00f6 gave a lecture on computer aided design. I watched Neil\u2019s video, wrote the rusty draft, but seriously returned to the documentation on Mar 6, 2022, after 7 weeks of understanding, practice, and digestion of the knowledge through the experience of computer controlled cutting, PCB design, and observations of other people\u2019s work. To me, it is like using statistics softwares such as SPSS, Stata, and MetLab: Always learn it under real tasks. Research \u00b6 The 2 key concepts of this week are: raster (\u4f4d\u56fe). Raster graphs are made by square pixel s. Pixel is the combination of picture and element, or in common language, a dot.

The higher the dpi is, the \u201cclearer\u201d a picture looks like. .jpeg , .gif are the most common raster files. vector (\u77e2\u91cf). Unlike pixel-based raster graphs, vector deploys geometric primitives to draw lines and curves which is independent from resolution and is smaller than raster pictures. Even if you zoom in, it looks as \u201cclear\u201d as the originnal size because the lines are always smooth which makes \u201cresolution\u201d basically not a concrete concept. .ai , .svg are the most commonly used vector files. Below is a vivid comparison between raster and vector pictures. To try the raster and vector designs, I used GIMP for 2D raster, Inkscape for 2D vector, and Fusion360 for 3D models, all of which are new to me. Before the course, my humble knowledge for computer aided design was Photoshops. Learning something new is challenging, which is not just about textbook knowledge. Take Fusion360 as an example, it took me around 10 days to get used to their basic functions, during which I regulated my emotion, motivation, as well as the cognitive strategies to learn them. When I gradually get desensitized, I found those professional softwares can be unbelievably convenient once knowing the logic and mechanisms to design really complicated things. Practice + Elaboration \u00b6 1. 2D Raster: GIMP \u00b6 GIMP is entirely built by volunteers (of course super professional). When I opened the software, I was immediately attracted by its plain layout as well as user-friendly interfaces. To me, the most frustrating thing to learn a new software is the initial setting up. Without the key menus, I would be lost on very basic issues, such as \u201chow to draw a line\u201d, \u201cwhy my strokes are colourless\u201d, \u201cwhere to find the colour\u201d, etc. So, no matter you want to use shapes or painting tools, I found the window name tool setting super useful as it shows the properties of the shape or painting tools. The menu may show either on the left or the right of the window, but looks like a TV or working board. To practise GIMP, I mainly tried the three basic ways of constraint to shapes. I loaded a vault boy picture from the game Fallout . Note that the format is .webp. I wanted to draw a red heart on his chest. First, I used oval shape to draw an oval. Then, I drew another oval, with some parts intersected. I chose combine mode, so the outlines will be combined to create a new shape. In fact, the four basic constraint logics are easy to understand, but powerful in design, no matter in 2D raster, vector or 3D models. Later, I chose intersect mode to draw the third oval which left only the overlapping area. It looked a bit like a frog. Well, why not make it into a frog? Remember to press enter to finish the drawing. Finally, I used paint bucket tool to paint the shape into red. I zoomed in to find that the shape I drew was not smooth but was pixel-based. It showed that indeed GIMP is a graphic design software specialized in raster images. 2. 2D Vector: Inkscape \u00b6 This is the 2nd pencil draft of the wooden bag for the final project. As an amateur, I studied thingiverse.com to get inspirations of the wooden box files with their svg files( The original .svg file before practice ). After comparing with my final design, I defined the parts that need modifications such as the flat bottom, interlocking designs, the holes to allow the handle, and the trapezoid front-upper side. The measurement is crucial in Inkscape design. I got the parameters including slot width and depth. I used eraser function to weed off the unnecessary parts, then closed the side with a straight line. For the residuals, I used white rectangular blocks to cover. After the trial, I could focus more on the technical parts for the coming laser cutting: the round corners, the bendable top, etc. So, I used the 3rd pencil draft to help illustrate. After the modification, I still need to change the line width to 0.02 mm for laser cutting, redesign the trapezoid lines, justify the jigsaw teeth interlocking designs, and take kerf into consideration. One thing I noticed was that Inkscape is indeed a software suitable for vector design. When I zoomed in, the lines are curves were as clear and smooth as the original settings. There was no issue of \u201cresolution\u201d. The modified .svg file after practice 3. 3D Raster and Vector: Fusion360 \u00b6 Fusion360 is a really powerful software to create 3D models. It has almost all necessary functions in 3D vector and parametric designs. The windows and menus are rather smartly categorized and displayed, but of course quite chunky for absolute beginners. My experience is to explore those functions in the desktops in Oulu Fablab. To start, I chose the front size as the canva (the size menu is on the right). I clicked solid - create - box to get a basic box. Right click the box, find Edit feature to define the numbers of the width, length, and hight. Shell allows you to choose a surface, set a width from the outline, then remove the rest from the inner outline to the middle point. The depth of the removal is from the chosen surface to the end of the opposite surface, but does not go through it. Fillet allows you to add curve to and edge, face, or feature. So I chose all the shape to create a 1 mm fillet. 3D design can be quite challenging as when you want to \u201cdrag\u201d a 2D shape, you have to use spatial imagination to define its direction and angle. Pretty much like tensor in physics. In fact, even in sketch , there are plenty of creative functions to create, modify, and constraint different elements. I sensed that there are many ways to get the same design. Practically, it helped me to understand how those design mechanisms and logics are intepreted in programming languages. When I am expressing my needs, my expressions were better structured in professional words. One tricky thing that may makes beginners surprised is the saving function. Fusion 360 is automatically linked to the internet so the save is understood as saving the file to the online account. So how to get an actual file to the PC? You have to click Export . I chose .stl (review: it is about vector) as the file format. To better illustrate the texture of the design, I right clicked the box, chose appearance , and revised how the box would be shown. Wood is of course closer to my final design. Note that this appearance is only for display but not determines the final printing work.

Computer controlled cutting \u00b6 This week Behnaz taught us computer controlled cutting using examples of vinyl cutter and laser cutter . To get a .svg file, the simplest way is to design on Inkscape . For parametric designs , I used Fusion 360 exporting and transfering it to pdf format. Fusion 360 is inescapable as Inkscape is powerful only except for parametric design. Research \u00b6 Some key notion to keep in mind: Vinyl cutting: .svg file + Roland CAMM 1 GS-24 vinyl cutter (real knife cut). Laser cutting: .pdf file + Laser cutter (Epilog Laser Fusion cutters, CO2 laser beam cut) raster-for engraving, which is about dots, pixels; vector-for cutting, which is about lines, flames (as more beam power is focused). The toughest part was the usage of fusion360 . At first, I was afraid of the new, professional software, but with the encouragement from Antti, Diep, and Behnaz, I calmed down, watched Neil\u2019s intro video, youtube tutorials, and some Chinese geeks\u2019 clips. After a good sleep, I opened fusion360, randomly drew a pentagon, tried some constraints, clicked here and there to explore the parameter setting window before it accidentally worked! I then changed the numeric parameters into mathmatic equations to achieve a better parametric design. I also spent several hours understanding the correct way of extruding the shapes. The same feeling took place again, which was just like those for Github programming as well as Inkscape. I could literally feel the convenience of parametric design and the reason to use it over Inkscape. Mentally, it proved learning curve from time to time: Inkscape-5 days; Github very basic programming-12 days; Fusion360-7 days. Gallery + Elaboration \u00b6 1. vinyl cutting \u00b6 observation and practice \u00b6 Starting from a basic Inkscape pattern, it is a good habit to add a frame for the convenience of later weeding. Weeding, according to Neil\u2019s video, means peeling the unnecessary parts. Ctrl + Shift + R can allow me to resize page to drawing or selection in Document Properties. To open or close the Roland vinyl cutter, push the handle at the left back side. Then, the two wheels can be lifted. It is a must to place the vinyl paper between the two wheels. The wheels must also be within the white label ranges in order to be detectable by the machine. The left white wheel defines the starting point of cutting. If you want to get a more precise measurement of the vinyl paper, you can press preference in printing window, then click \u201c Get from Machine \u201d. This allows the scanner of the vinyl cutter to horizontally run across the vinyl paper. To transfer the .svg file to Roland vinyl cutter, find Roland CutStudio in Extensions , then press \u201cOpen\u201d. It is advisable to select \u201c Edge mode\u201d in Sheet category by pressing up/down bottoms. Here we go. A note: the size of the vinyl paper should be moderate. Avoid thin one. Importantly, the most obvious difference between vinyl and laser cutter is that vinyl cutter literally uses sharp knife to press on the material to get the lines. You can see the knife cut. The most standarized way to weed (peel) the usable sticker is to use tweezer, especially when there are exquisite spots or lines. Of course, if they were just basic patterns, or to make the lessons more attractive to youngsters, fingers and hands are parallelly flexible tools. Transferring sheets are powerful if you want to save the cut work for later use. The tough side of vinyl paper is slippery, allowing transferring sheet to attach them tightly. After this procedure, you can get both the stikers and transferring sheets to show the sticky sides. Be careful of the dusts, of course. This was the end of observation and practice session, which was quite straightforward experience. The frame is an important part to allow convenient weeding. Also, it helps to justify positive and negative patterns as soon I encountered when doing my own giant panda printing practice. self design and final work \u00b6 I got a panda bear .svg file from the Internet (the file can be found at the end), added a frame in Inkscape, exported it to Roland Cutstudio, made 3 sizes, then set up the cutter (mode: edge) as in the observation session. I used black vinyl as panda bear fur is a combination of white and black. When it came to weeding (peeling), Diep asked about how to define which parts to leave. To be honest, I had the same concern the day before. My friend who knows seal cutting comforted me that it is my justification of positive and negative sides. Therefore, you can see that on the left side, the little pattern was the residual that I didn\u2019t need simply because I knew the color distribution of panda. Also, the larger the sticker is (my largest size was 70mm), the easier to weed and to allow more complicated line designs. After weeding, I used transfering sheet. I pressed it hard to the work, then lifted and got the usable stickers. The final work looks great. The sticky side was quite strong. Also, the rough side seems durable (after 3 weeks they are still tough). 2. laser cutting \u00b6 observation and practice \u00b6 No matter how beautiful the design is, to get the laser cutting started, Behnaz showed us the safety issues that everyone should be serious about: NEVER LET THE LASER CUTTING WORK ALONE. ALWAYS KEEP AN EYE ON IT. Luckily, FabLab Oulu installed a separate sensor to detect whether there are people within 2 meters when the laser cutting is on. To turn on the laser printer: turn the round p\u00e4\u00e4kytkin (headswitch) from 0 to 1 (This is to open the vacuum cleaner to inhale the hazardous combustion)\u2192 turn the red handle to the air inside of the cutter flow (it is crucial as the air can be blown out just next to the laser beam shooter and blows away the combustion to be \u201cwelcomed\u201d by the vacuum cleaner. You can hear the noise). \u2192 Turn on the power switch of the machine. If something really starts to ignite, number one: stay calm. Number two: open the laster cutter lid to activate the interlock. However, if materials like cardboard gets more flames because of the input air, rush to get the nearby fire blanket to smother the fire . Fire blanket should be the first priority because extinguisher is ok but it may create a huge mess to the machine (maybe cost even more to repair afterwards :(), never to say not many people know how to properly use the extinguisher. A fire blanket looks like below: Behnaz first introduced us a key concept of laser cutting that is directly related to parametric design: kerf . Kerf is the material part that laser beam burns away (and becomes combustion), which is why laser can \u201ccut\u201d materials. When we do parametric design with consideration of high precision, the width of kerf matters. For example, I hope to set the pentagon slot width to be 3 mm . If I simply set the number to be 3 mm, the kerf will make it more than 3mm as it burns slightly more, which can cause instability when interlocking the slots. That was the reason I let set the parameter of \u201cslotwidth\u201d to be \u201cmaterial thickness - kerf\u201d , instead of assigning a fixed number. The question comes to: what is the width of kerf ? Behnaz asked us to laser cut on our own to measure the kerf among different materials. This time we used MDF and acrylic and see their differences. It is rather easy to laser cut. There are two steps: Desktop . Open .svg file in Inkscape \u2192 set the line width to be 0.02 mm \u2192 save as PDF file \u2192 open the PDF file \u2192 ctrl + p \u2192 examine the Advanced and General windows to set up the printing parameters. \u2192 press save and ok First, save the Inkscape .svg file as PDF file. Open the pdf, click the printing to get the blue window (Epilog Engraver WinX64 Fusion Properties) \u2192 Click the Advanced option to choose the preset modes (i.e., In our session, we used 3mm-MDF-engrave+cut and 3mm-acrylic-engrave+cut) \u2192 Finalize the setting in General opion. 300 DPI is fair enough for most cases; raster is for engraving while vector is for line cutting . We also learned the meaning of DPI . It stands for \u201c dots per inch \u201d. As each time the laser beam burns a little \u201cdot\u201d of the surface, when the dpi is 254, the laser beam can surely burn every corner of the inch. In this regard, the preset dpi 300 assumes that there are slightly overlapping burnt parts, which is enough for most engraving work. Otherwise, the surface might be over engraved (burnt like chocolate). Laser Cutter Open the lid \u2192 place the cutting material on the working table \u2192 set the Focus/Jog \u2192 select the Job \u2192 Press go \u2192 MONITOR THE CUTTING PROCESS AND DON\u2019T GO AWAY FOR SAFETY REASONS. First, open the lid, place the cutting material on the \u201cbed\u201d, or working table . Press it with metal weight if necessary. Then, to run the laser cutter, look at the small screen. Use the joystick to move up and down to select the functions. Do three things in a row: Set Focus. Laser beams are generated, output, then concentrated at the \u201cwaist\u201d point where the power is the strongest. The reason to set the focus is hence to get the \u201cbeam waist\u201d. Since the laser producer tool\u2019s height is fixed, you should move up/down the \u201cbed\u201d to realize the focus setting. - Use a **triangular plate** to hang between the two screws of the laser cutting head (see below). It can assist we find the most powerful focus of laser beam of this machine: 2 inches. ![](../images/lcp17.jpg) - Turn the joystick left to select the speed (see below). Two arrows means fast, one arrow means slow. Usually you will start from the fast mode. Then turn the joystick up and down to move the working table. When you feel the triangle touches the material, shift it to slow mode to adjust the focus gently. ![](../images/lcp15.jpg) Set Jog. This is to set up the beginning point of laser cutting. An red auxiliary beam can assist the setting. Select the Job. Use the joystick to choose which laser cutting work your would like to do. Diep and Antti R measured the MDF kerf (around 0.13mm). Antti J and me measured acrylic kerf. I used the vernier caliper twice. The first result was 0.065 mm, which was biased because I hadn\u2019t put the 10 small chips tightly together. When I did it twice, the result was more reasonable: 0.102 mm. In this regard, I could estimate that the kerf for acrylic laser was 0.1mm and set it in the parametric design. (from Diep\u2019s measurement) Then, we tested different laser speed and power on MDF to see different effects. The speed, power and frequency are the independent variables to control the laser beam results. The beam power is stronger either with slower speed, more power or frequency. The results are meaningful: for vector cutting (upper part), the default values worked well, but if the speed was 40 (too fast), the laser could not cut through the MDF. Similar result happened if the power was only half (50%). When the speed is defaulted while removing 20% of the power, the vector cut still went well. We estimated that the vector cut on MDF could be effective if the power is above 60%. The frequency seemed to have little effect on vector cut (middle). The different raster (lower part) settings had remarkable effects on the engraving results. Even on the same surface, you can set different degrees of raster by changing the power. We also tested different laser conditions on acrylic. The results are interesting: If the speed is 80% with other settings being defaulted, the laser cannot cut through the acrylic. When engraving, if the power is 5, you simply could not see apparent patterns on the surface. We were joking that it might be \u201cuseful\u201d in cheating :) Then, we tested the effects of different focuses of laser beam. The laser beam was most concentrated on the thinnest point, or the \u201c beam waist \u201d, which has the most power. The upper and lower parts are like a sand clock. The results were not so obvious by appearance, but if I touched the engraved surfaces, the focused one was indeed tougher than others. Last, Behnaz introduced us a smaller laser printer in Oulu FabLab. It does not need extra setup for focus , but requires more manual work to install the air tube to a electric fan. The setup of the smaller printer is rather straightforward: turn on the switch and connect it to the preset laptop. Behnaz guided us to see what different DPI sets were look like in this printer. In fact, I was more secured to realize the same blue window of Epilog, as it meant that I could use existing skills to change parameters. It was also a good review of vector , raster , DPI , as well as the preset parameters in Advanced window. We tested 3 DPI settings: 150, 300(default), 600. The result was as below: As DPI number increases, the \u201cresolution\u201d also goes up, which makes laser beam burn more intensively on the material surface, resulting in a darker engraving pattern. self design and final work \u00b6 I really appreciate Behnaz to help me understand the meaning of those formats. Also thanks Antti R to help me with the codes for hyperlink in Github. I met some problems using Fusion360 at the begining of the week mostly because I felt hesitant and scared of new software. I was anxious about the functions or unfamiliar keyboard combinations of Fusion360, just like when I started to programme at CMD, Inkscape, or generally speaking, anything new including some classic RPGs such as Neverwinter Night, the Elder Scroll, etc. or living in a new country. It is more about personality. So, I tried to dodge Fusion360, but when it came to Behnaz\u2019s week for computer-controlled cutting, I must face it as Inkscape is smart except for one thing: parametric design! After hours of nervous attempt, I practised designing a pentagon with slots. First, I randomly drew a pentagon under the menu of sketch + create . Then I clicked polygon - circumscribed polygon (actually the three selections are just different ways to define a polygon). It does not matter which side in the space to be the 2D canva. It did not have to be accurate for the size of the polygon as later I could use parameteric designs to constrain the key numbers. While dragging the shape on the canva, I moved the mouse to left change the edge into 5. After this, I could get a raw, unparametrically constrained pentagon . Now comes to the parametric design, which Neil, Yrjo, Behnaz as well as numerous vtubers emphasized. The logic is rather simple: Instead of setting key numbers (side length, angle, etc.) by hand for endless times in complicated design, parametric design allows you to define certain sides, lengths, angles, and into parameters . The parameters can be numbers, or mathmatic equations. It is powerful as when you change some factors, e.g. the customers hope to have different sizes of the product, everything will be automatically and smartly reset which cannot be achieved by Inkscape but Fusion360. Instead of setting parameters by hand for endless times in complicated design, you can just define certain parameters with their expressions (length, angle, etc.) . So I clicked the part + sketch (the radial menu reminds me of the counterpart in Neverwinter Nights). It was chunky at first, but useful after getting used to it. For example, for the pendagon, I named each side as \u201cside\u201d. I also named a kerf (measured as 0.1 mm in previous observation), the material thickness (expressed as mdfthickness ) in 3 mm (MDF board). The rest parameters were thus defined as: slot width(expressed as slotwidth ): mdfthickness - kerf halfside: (side-slotwidth)/2 As a test, I modified the kerf into 0.3mm, then the other related parameters were immediately reset. Returned to the original design, the \u201cslotwidth\u201d is still 2.9mm, but defined by equations ; The \u201chalfside\u201d was also smartly reset:) The next step was to export the design as a printable pdf. I thought things would be quite easy and straightforward ( extrude \u2192 set a number of thickness \u2192 generate a new drawing from the design ). However, I was so naive, which ultimately made me refine and reflect on the trouble that I wanted to dodge. At the beinning, as the picture below, I found it a bit strange with unconnected lines. I clicked the drawing view settings and found that the lines were connected if I changed the scale in to 1:2 . Then I happily exported it into pdf format. When I inspected the pdf file in Inkscape of the Oulu FabLab desktop, I found the problem: ok, everything was shrunk into half size including the slot. Apparently, I could not use a slot with 1.5 mm in MDF as the thickness was 3 mm. As time was very limited, I needed to hand in some tentative assignments on time, I directly used Inkscape to close the 1:1 scale pentagon lines through drawing. Then, I selected all the lines to set the width to be 0.02 mm for laser cutting (not graving). I observed that the laser cutting work ran twice: first to cut the unconnected lines, then pinpointedly cut the modified parts from Inkscape, which proved its smartness in 2D design. I duplicated the pentagon to get 5 extra pieces. After waiting for 1 minute, I took out the pieces. Before playing, I used the vernier caliper to measure the side and slot. The results were satisfactory: side-53mm; slotwidth-0.3mm (0.1mm\u2019s credit for kerf). Finally I could play the pieces by putting them together. It looked stable and nice. I particularly checked the interlocking part: since the slothdepth was 0.5 mm, the total interlock depth was 1.0 mm. It was fairly stable, but would be better If I made the slotwidth deeper, say, 1 mm. Also, the nodes and other interlocking designs are all worth exploring. Behnaz also found that among the five slots, some of them were more stable than others, which may be the differences between horizontal and diagonal laser beam traces. As for the function, pentagon looks elegant, so I would use Inkscape to draw some patterns or pictures and use it as a badge. The wizard card in Harry Potter is a good example. I still wanted to \u201cclose\u201d the disconnected lines. Behnaz explained how the function of extrude works, which opened a great DLC of the week\u2019s project and occupied all my free time in 2022 lunar new year, which unexpectedly made me learn something new. I clicked the pentagon, extruded with 3mm (to match the MDF thickness), got a 3D object, and thought everything was ok. However, the lines were still not connected in the drawing, which drove me confused at night. I consulted Diep. She calmed me down then helped me through remote screen sharing. She suspected that I hadn\u2019t selected the whole shape but only the frame whose extruded version had not covered the whole design. I tried again by drawing and extruding a new pentagon. This time the whole shape was selected. Then, I created a drawing and ok, scale 1:1, lines connected. At least it was clear that the lines could only be closed as long as the object is extruded on a surface rather than the frame. This time I was stuck because no matter how I changed the \u201cselect\u201d, the pentagon with slots was like a hollow ghost which was too naughty or transparent to be captured. I nearly gave up until I clicked the \u201csurface\u201d and added a \u201cpatch\u201d to forcely create a surface within the shape. It seemed successful. As the direction was reversed, I set the extrude parameter to be -3 mm. It worked in a rather weird way\u2026 I created a drawing and finally got a proper work even though the procedure was not the optimal. This was the most meaningful, diligent and hard working lunar new year so far in my life. What I learned most from this week is that no matter how difficult the tasks might be, there will be multiple solutions. Also, if a software looks chunky and monstrous at the beginning, it is usually because of the abundance of functions and super convenience to solve specific issues. Unlike \u201cuser friendly\u201d Excel and Word (they are easy to start but quite professional and powerful at the end), it is just the contrary way to reach suitable users. Behnaz shared a small tip I found quite useful nowadays: When it is stuck, close and reopen.

Laser cutting: .pdf file + Laser cutter (Epilog Laser Fusion cutters, CO2 laser beam cut) raster-for engraving, which is about dots, pixels; vector-for cutting, which is about lines, flames (as more beam power is focused). The toughest part was the usage of fusion360 . At first, I was afraid of the new, professional software, but with the encouragement from Antti, Diep, and Behnaz, I calmed down, watched Neil\u2019s intro video, youtube tutorials, and some Chinese geeks\u2019 clips. After a good sleep, I opened fusion360, randomly drew a pentagon, tried some constraints, clicked here and there to explore the parameter setting window before it accidentally worked! I then changed the numeric parameters into mathmatic equations to achieve a better parametric design. I also spent several hours understanding the correct way of extruding the shapes. The same feeling took place again, which was just like those for Github programming as well as Inkscape. I could literally feel the convenience of parametric design and the reason to use it over Inkscape. Mentally, it proved learning curve from time to time: Inkscape-5 days; Github very basic programming-12 days; Fusion360-7 days.","title":"Research"},{"location":"assignments/week04/#gallery-elaboration","text":"","title":"Gallery + Elaboration"},{"location":"assignments/week04/#1-vinyl-cutting","text":"","title":"1. vinyl cutting"},{"location":"assignments/week04/#observation-and-practice","text":"Starting from a basic Inkscape pattern, it is a good habit to add a frame for the convenience of later weeding. Weeding, according to Neil\u2019s video, means peeling the unnecessary parts. Ctrl + Shift + R can allow me to resize page to drawing or selection in Document Properties. To open or close the Roland vinyl cutter, push the handle at the left back side. Then, the two wheels can be lifted. It is a must to place the vinyl paper between the two wheels. The wheels must also be within the white label ranges in order to be detectable by the machine. The left white wheel defines the starting point of cutting. If you want to get a more precise measurement of the vinyl paper, you can press preference in printing window, then click \u201c Get from Machine \u201d. This allows the scanner of the vinyl cutter to horizontally run across the vinyl paper. To transfer the .svg file to Roland vinyl cutter, find Roland CutStudio in Extensions , then press \u201cOpen\u201d. It is advisable to select \u201c Edge mode\u201d in Sheet category by pressing up/down bottoms. Here we go. A note: the size of the vinyl paper should be moderate. Avoid thin one. Importantly, the most obvious difference between vinyl and laser cutter is that vinyl cutter literally uses sharp knife to press on the material to get the lines. You can see the knife cut. The most standarized way to weed (peel) the usable sticker is to use tweezer, especially when there are exquisite spots or lines. Of course, if they were just basic patterns, or to make the lessons more attractive to youngsters, fingers and hands are parallelly flexible tools. Transferring sheets are powerful if you want to save the cut work for later use. The tough side of vinyl paper is slippery, allowing transferring sheet to attach them tightly. After this procedure, you can get both the stikers and transferring sheets to show the sticky sides. Be careful of the dusts, of course. This was the end of observation and practice session, which was quite straightforward experience. The frame is an important part to allow convenient weeding. Also, it helps to justify positive and negative patterns as soon I encountered when doing my own giant panda printing practice.","title":"observation and practice"},{"location":"assignments/week04/#self-design-and-final-work","text":"I got a panda bear .svg file from the Internet (the file can be found at the end), added a frame in Inkscape, exported it to Roland Cutstudio, made 3 sizes, then set up the cutter (mode: edge) as in the observation session. I used black vinyl as panda bear fur is a combination of white and black. When it came to weeding (peeling), Diep asked about how to define which parts to leave. To be honest, I had the same concern the day before. My friend who knows seal cutting comforted me that it is my justification of positive and negative sides. Therefore, you can see that on the left side, the little pattern was the residual that I didn\u2019t need simply because I knew the color distribution of panda. Also, the larger the sticker is (my largest size was 70mm), the easier to weed and to allow more complicated line designs. After weeding, I used transfering sheet. I pressed it hard to the work, then lifted and got the usable stickers. The final work looks great. The sticky side was quite strong. Also, the rough side seems durable (after 3 weeks they are still tough).","title":"self design and final work"},{"location":"assignments/week04/#2-laser-cutting","text":"","title":"2. laser cutting"},{"location":"assignments/week04/#observation-and-practice_1","text":"No matter how beautiful the design is, to get the laser cutting started, Behnaz showed us the safety issues that everyone should be serious about: NEVER LET THE LASER CUTTING WORK ALONE. ALWAYS KEEP AN EYE ON IT. Luckily, FabLab Oulu installed a separate sensor to detect whether there are people within 2 meters when the laser cutting is on. To turn on the laser printer: turn the round p\u00e4\u00e4kytkin (headswitch) from 0 to 1 (This is to open the vacuum cleaner to inhale the hazardous combustion)\u2192 turn the red handle to the air inside of the cutter flow (it is crucial as the air can be blown out just next to the laser beam shooter and blows away the combustion to be \u201cwelcomed\u201d by the vacuum cleaner. You can hear the noise). \u2192 Turn on the power switch of the machine. If something really starts to ignite, number one: stay calm. Number two: open the laster cutter lid to activate the interlock. However, if materials like cardboard gets more flames because of the input air, rush to get the nearby fire blanket to smother the fire . Fire blanket should be the first priority because extinguisher is ok but it may create a huge mess to the machine (maybe cost even more to repair afterwards :(), never to say not many people know how to properly use the extinguisher. A fire blanket looks like below: Behnaz first introduced us a key concept of laser cutting that is directly related to parametric design: kerf . Kerf is the material part that laser beam burns away (and becomes combustion), which is why laser can \u201ccut\u201d materials. When we do parametric design with consideration of high precision, the width of kerf matters. For example, I hope to set the pentagon slot width to be 3 mm . If I simply set the number to be 3 mm, the kerf will make it more than 3mm as it burns slightly more, which can cause instability when interlocking the slots. That was the reason I let set the parameter of \u201cslotwidth\u201d to be \u201cmaterial thickness - kerf\u201d , instead of assigning a fixed number. The question comes to: what is the width of kerf ? Behnaz asked us to laser cut on our own to measure the kerf among different materials. This time we used MDF and acrylic and see their differences. It is rather easy to laser cut. There are two steps: Desktop . Open .svg file in Inkscape \u2192 set the line width to be 0.02 mm \u2192 save as PDF file \u2192 open the PDF file \u2192 ctrl + p \u2192 examine the Advanced and General windows to set up the printing parameters. \u2192 press save and ok First, save the Inkscape .svg file as PDF file. Open the pdf, click the printing to get the blue window (Epilog Engraver WinX64 Fusion Properties) \u2192 Click the Advanced option to choose the preset modes (i.e., In our session, we used 3mm-MDF-engrave+cut and 3mm-acrylic-engrave+cut) \u2192 Finalize the setting in General opion. 300 DPI is fair enough for most cases; raster is for engraving while vector is for line cutting . We also learned the meaning of DPI . It stands for \u201c dots per inch \u201d. As each time the laser beam burns a little \u201cdot\u201d of the surface, when the dpi is 254, the laser beam can surely burn every corner of the inch. In this regard, the preset dpi 300 assumes that there are slightly overlapping burnt parts, which is enough for most engraving work. Otherwise, the surface might be over engraved (burnt like chocolate). Laser Cutter Open the lid \u2192 place the cutting material on the working table \u2192 set the Focus/Jog \u2192 select the Job \u2192 Press go \u2192 MONITOR THE CUTTING PROCESS AND DON\u2019T GO AWAY FOR SAFETY REASONS. First, open the lid, place the cutting material on the \u201cbed\u201d, or working table . Press it with metal weight if necessary. Then, to run the laser cutter, look at the small screen. Use the joystick to move up and down to select the functions. Do three things in a row: Set Focus. Laser beams are generated, output, then concentrated at the \u201cwaist\u201d point where the power is the strongest. The reason to set the focus is hence to get the \u201cbeam waist\u201d. Since the laser producer tool\u2019s height is fixed, you should move up/down the \u201cbed\u201d to realize the focus setting. - Use a **triangular plate** to hang between the two screws of the laser cutting head (see below). It can assist we find the most powerful focus of laser beam of this machine: 2 inches. ![](../images/lcp17.jpg) - Turn the joystick left to select the speed (see below). Two arrows means fast, one arrow means slow. Usually you will start from the fast mode. Then turn the joystick up and down to move the working table. When you feel the triangle touches the material, shift it to slow mode to adjust the focus gently. ![](../images/lcp15.jpg) Set Jog. This is to set up the beginning point of laser cutting. An red auxiliary beam can assist the setting. Select the Job. Use the joystick to choose which laser cutting work your would like to do. Diep and Antti R measured the MDF kerf (around 0.13mm). Antti J and me measured acrylic kerf. I used the vernier caliper twice. The first result was 0.065 mm, which was biased because I hadn\u2019t put the 10 small chips tightly together. When I did it twice, the result was more reasonable: 0.102 mm. In this regard, I could estimate that the kerf for acrylic laser was 0.1mm and set it in the parametric design. (from Diep\u2019s measurement) Then, we tested different laser speed and power on MDF to see different effects. The speed, power and frequency are the independent variables to control the laser beam results. The beam power is stronger either with slower speed, more power or frequency. The results are meaningful: for vector cutting (upper part), the default values worked well, but if the speed was 40 (too fast), the laser could not cut through the MDF. Similar result happened if the power was only half (50%). When the speed is defaulted while removing 20% of the power, the vector cut still went well. We estimated that the vector cut on MDF could be effective if the power is above 60%. The frequency seemed to have little effect on vector cut (middle). The different raster (lower part) settings had remarkable effects on the engraving results. Even on the same surface, you can set different degrees of raster by changing the power. We also tested different laser conditions on acrylic. The results are interesting: If the speed is 80% with other settings being defaulted, the laser cannot cut through the acrylic. When engraving, if the power is 5, you simply could not see apparent patterns on the surface. We were joking that it might be \u201cuseful\u201d in cheating :) Then, we tested the effects of different focuses of laser beam. The laser beam was most concentrated on the thinnest point, or the \u201c beam waist \u201d, which has the most power. The upper and lower parts are like a sand clock. The results were not so obvious by appearance, but if I touched the engraved surfaces, the focused one was indeed tougher than others. Last, Behnaz introduced us a smaller laser printer in Oulu FabLab. It does not need extra setup for focus , but requires more manual work to install the air tube to a electric fan. The setup of the smaller printer is rather straightforward: turn on the switch and connect it to the preset laptop. Behnaz guided us to see what different DPI sets were look like in this printer. In fact, I was more secured to realize the same blue window of Epilog, as it meant that I could use existing skills to change parameters. It was also a good review of vector , raster , DPI , as well as the preset parameters in Advanced window. We tested 3 DPI settings: 150, 300(default), 600. The result was as below: As DPI number increases, the \u201cresolution\u201d also goes up, which makes laser beam burn more intensively on the material surface, resulting in a darker engraving pattern.","title":"observation and practice"},{"location":"assignments/week04/#self-design-and-final-work_1","text":"I really appreciate Behnaz to help me understand the meaning of those formats. Also thanks Antti R to help me with the codes for hyperlink in Github. I met some problems using Fusion360 at the begining of the week mostly because I felt hesitant and scared of new software. I was anxious about the functions or unfamiliar keyboard combinations of Fusion360, just like when I started to programme at CMD, Inkscape, or generally speaking, anything new including some classic RPGs such as Neverwinter Night, the Elder Scroll, etc. or living in a new country. It is more about personality. So, I tried to dodge Fusion360, but when it came to Behnaz\u2019s week for computer-controlled cutting, I must face it as Inkscape is smart except for one thing: parametric design! After hours of nervous attempt, I practised designing a pentagon with slots. First, I randomly drew a pentagon under the menu of sketch + create . Then I clicked polygon - circumscribed polygon (actually the three selections are just different ways to define a polygon). It does not matter which side in the space to be the 2D canva. It did not have to be accurate for the size of the polygon as later I could use parameteric designs to constrain the key numbers. While dragging the shape on the canva, I moved the mouse to left change the edge into 5. After this, I could get a raw, unparametrically constrained pentagon . Now comes to the parametric design, which Neil, Yrjo, Behnaz as well as numerous vtubers emphasized. The logic is rather simple: Instead of setting key numbers (side length, angle, etc.) by hand for endless times in complicated design, parametric design allows you to define certain sides, lengths, angles, and into parameters . The parameters can be numbers, or mathmatic equations. It is powerful as when you change some factors, e.g. the customers hope to have different sizes of the product, everything will be automatically and smartly reset which cannot be achieved by Inkscape but Fusion360. Instead of setting parameters by hand for endless times in complicated design, you can just define certain parameters with their expressions (length, angle, etc.) . So I clicked the part + sketch (the radial menu reminds me of the counterpart in Neverwinter Nights). It was chunky at first, but useful after getting used to it. For example, for the pendagon, I named each side as \u201cside\u201d. I also named a kerf (measured as 0.1 mm in previous observation), the material thickness (expressed as mdfthickness ) in 3 mm (MDF board). The rest parameters were thus defined as: slot width(expressed as slotwidth ): mdfthickness - kerf halfside: (side-slotwidth)/2 As a test, I modified the kerf into 0.3mm, then the other related parameters were immediately reset. Returned to the original design, the \u201cslotwidth\u201d is still 2.9mm, but defined by equations ; The \u201chalfside\u201d was also smartly reset:) The next step was to export the design as a printable pdf. I thought things would be quite easy and straightforward ( extrude \u2192 set a number of thickness \u2192 generate a new drawing from the design ). However, I was so naive, which ultimately made me refine and reflect on the trouble that I wanted to dodge. At the beinning, as the picture below, I found it a bit strange with unconnected lines. I clicked the drawing view settings and found that the lines were connected if I changed the scale in to 1:2 . Then I happily exported it into pdf format. When I inspected the pdf file in Inkscape of the Oulu FabLab desktop, I found the problem: ok, everything was shrunk into half size including the slot. Apparently, I could not use a slot with 1.5 mm in MDF as the thickness was 3 mm. As time was very limited, I needed to hand in some tentative assignments on time, I directly used Inkscape to close the 1:1 scale pentagon lines through drawing. Then, I selected all the lines to set the width to be 0.02 mm for laser cutting (not graving). I observed that the laser cutting work ran twice: first to cut the unconnected lines, then pinpointedly cut the modified parts from Inkscape, which proved its smartness in 2D design. I duplicated the pentagon to get 5 extra pieces. After waiting for 1 minute, I took out the pieces. Before playing, I used the vernier caliper to measure the side and slot. The results were satisfactory: side-53mm; slotwidth-0.3mm (0.1mm\u2019s credit for kerf). Finally I could play the pieces by putting them together. It looked stable and nice. I particularly checked the interlocking part: since the slothdepth was 0.5 mm, the total interlock depth was 1.0 mm. It was fairly stable, but would be better If I made the slotwidth deeper, say, 1 mm. Also, the nodes and other interlocking designs are all worth exploring. Behnaz also found that among the five slots, some of them were more stable than others, which may be the differences between horizontal and diagonal laser beam traces.

Electronics Production \u00b6 Antti M\u00e4ntyniemi kindly used reciprocal teaching and maker education to let an absolute beginner not afraid of gettting started to learn the electronics. Research \u00b6 How to get a PCB \u00b6 Stage 1 Background knowledge for absolute beginners \u00b6 What is a PCB? What is it used for? This sounds like a stupid question for engineering students, but it is still a basic question like \u201cWhat is scaffolding\u201d to outsiders of pedagogy, or \u201cdisenchantment\u201d to sociology starters. So, PCB(printed circuit board) looks like below. PCB industry started at the beginning of the 20th century. Bofore that, elctronic circuits were directly connected to each other in a point-to-point way, installed on a chassis. The circuits were heavy, large, bulky and expensive. From 1903, inventors including Albert Hanson, Thomas Edison, and Arthur Berry discovered that they could laminate flat copper layers (or foil ) on an insulating board, where conductors could be plated. The lines on the PCB board are called circuit traces or tracks . They can allow electricity to go through the components where programmes are installed. However, if it is a fresh board waiting to be used, like what I learned in the first week, it can be called a PWB (printed wiring board). In the following part, there are more key terms to keep in mind. Machine. The machine for the PCB milling in FabLab Oulu is Roland SRM-20. Of course, you have to set up parameters and run the machine from the connected desktop. Drill Drill literally means to dig a whole through a surface. In pedagogy, \u201cdrill\u201d is interpreted as practice. Antti M\u00e4ntyniemi started the introduction by asking me whether I know 3D printing. I said no. Then, he asked if I know x, y, z axis in spatial design. I said yes. Now it is easy to understand: drilling in electronics design means to move the machine tool up and down vertically. That is why drill deals with z axis. Mill Mill is not to make a house to grind grains into flour. In electronics design, mill means to move the tool horizonally , hence x and y axis are used. rectangular-bit or v-bit. When drilling and milling the PCB plate, the machine will use bit to realize the task. The 2 most frequently used bits are rectangular and V-shape (as below). When the PCB plate is perfectly flat, the rectangular bit leaves a milled track with the width to be 0.4mm, while the V-bit, depending on how deep it drills into the copper foil, makes the width ranging from 0.2-0.5 mm. When the PCB plate is curved, both bit shapes can create irregular milled tracks. It is quite abstract to talk about 0.2-0.5mm. So I used the vernier caliper to visualize the parameters. In FabLab Oulu, the most commonly used bits are rectangular style as below. PCB blank. The raw PCB working plate is called PCB blank. It has two layers. The lower part is a 1.6 mm plate; the upper surface is a 35\u03bcm copper foil (*1 mm = 1,000 \u03bcm). The PCB format I made this time was UPDI format. Sacrificial MDF bed. This is a thick plate to hold the PCB working plate. MDF is a common choice. This sacrificial bed surface needs to be polished and engraved after worn out. It is very important to know the thickness of PCB plate (e.g., in my assignment the thickness is 1.635mm .) because if you set the drill tool into the bed and mill, the tool can be easily broken. Isolation cutting Stage 2 Get 2 .rml files (the inner tracks & outline ) for milling \u00b6 In Stage 2, I will introduce how to set up two files to be milled: PCB traces (the body part) and outline (the shape) on https://mods.cba.mit.edu/. It looks quite scary at the first glance, but I marked the 6 main stepss to click and ignore at the same time. The purpose of the big picture is to set the necessary parameters including the size of the PCB, the milling (peeling) parts, the width and depth of traces. https://mods.cba.mit.edu/ allows FabLab Oulu users to set up parameters remotely through the big map above. What I did was to go to the website \u2192 right click the mouse \u2192 choose programm \u2192 choose open server program \u2192 choose Roland PCB svg (the final file format is .svg). step 1 delete the unnecessary window: the WebSocket device (press \u201cdelete\u201d). Then, right click the mouse in the empty place \u2192 choose file: save \u2192 get a new window named save file . Just leave it there at the moment. step 2 load 2 .svg file (PCB traces and outline) First, Antti gave me 2 pre-set .svg files for the PCB shape and body. The whole work generally consists of 2 sections: the traces/inner paths of PCB, and the outline or shape of the PCB (for example, in this work the shape is a regular USB). step 3 Invert the .svg files. Look at the left upper corner of the whole map, select the inner paths .SVG file. In the right window, click invert to redefine the zone to be removed. It is important to remember that, in PCB milling setting, the black parts will be removed by the tools. The white parts are the copper layers that connnect the components via currents. So unlike vinyl cutting, you definetely don\u2019t want to make the PCB functions inverted. step 4 Set PCB default. Without special intention, usually you don\u2019t have to change anything. Usually, you will just go on. step 5 Set the mill raster 2D parameters. This is a key step to get the \u201cmillable\u201d .rml files. Since a milled PCB consists of the traces and an outline, there will be 2 .rml files which require you to return from step 2 to step 5 to set up the outline svg file later. As you can see, the 2D mill file is basically a raster file which considers pixels rather than lines. The tool diameter determines the copper zones to be removed. The bigger the tool diameter is, the more copper surface will be removed. The cut depth defines how deep the tool will go into the board. Antti shared his experience of the three parameters: the diameter to be 0.3 mm; the cut depth as 0.07 mm (It is interesting as the thickness of copper layer is 35 \u03bcm (0.035 mm), so 0.07 mm doubles the thickness, allowing the 2 depth settings to be equal. Of course, you can also try different tool diameters. Always keep in mind that the depth is critical especially when you have to set Roland machine by hand. For instance, in this PCB board, the thickness is 1.635 mm, so you should limit the max depth to be reasonable. Otherwise, the tool may drill through the whole PCB board, breaking itself when conducting the milling work. After this, click calculate to get a redefined file which will be downloaded automatically. The format is .rml . If you review the refined file, it shows the paths to be milled. The red arrows are the general sequences that the tool will go. step 6 Finalize the setting. First, reset the x/y/z parameters in origin to be all 0. Then, click move to origin . The purpose is to generate a tool path that Roland milling machine can understand. Also, rembmer to connect the outputs with inputs of step 1. Now, redo steps 3-6 to set up the milling work of the outline. One imporant note: click the invert You definitely do not want the whole PCB work to be removed away, leaving only the empty shape. After getting the two .rml files. Congratulations! I finished the PCB files setting. Stage 3 Let\u2019s mill it on machine! \u00b6 In Stage, I practised realizing the milled PCB on Roland SRM-20 machine. The working area is as below. You have to use the connected desktop to set up the machine. step 1 stabilize the PCB plate and insert the tools When milling work is on, the tool moves horizonally across the copper surface, which might cause subtle movement. In order to make the PCB plate stable, Antti introduced a smart solution: Use tapes to both the PCB bottom side and the top of the sacrificial bed. Apply a few drops of strong glue to attach the 2 sides. Avoid using too much glue as it may cause bulge to make the PCB plate not flat. Press a metal plate to attach the two sides for a while. Now it is to insert the tools manually. My left hand held and push the tool vertically into the small hole of the working head; My right hand used the screwer to fix the tool (clockwise: fix; anticlockwise: loose). step 2 set up the desktop parameters for Roland SRM-20 The general menu looks as below: There are 5 small steps in the menu. I marked the critical contents in red (most related to z axis). Press View. The tool will go to the original position. Press X/Y at the bottom (Move). Then click \u2191\u2193\u2190\u2192 arrows of X/Y axis to set the starting point of milling on X/Y axis (the working surface). The distance of movement is defined by Cursor Steop . If you choose Continue, the tool will move while you click the left mouse. If you choose x100 , it moves for 1 mm. Press X/Y on the dark zone on the right (Set Origin Point). It will reset the X/Y point to be \u201corigin\u201d, shown as 0.00 mm on the left. Press Z at the bottom (Move). When moving the tool vertically, be careful when you see it is going to touch the PCB surface. Change the Cursor Step from Continue to x100 then to x10 to adjust the tool. Next, click the cut on the right bottom to open a new pop-up window as below: Delete previous jobs then click Add to load the 2 .rml files generated in Stage 2 (inner traces & outline). It is suggested to do the inner traces and outline milling in order. I used the red tool to do the traces, then the yellow one for the outline. As there are many residuals on top of the PCB, it is a good habit to use vacuum cleaner to remove the dust. Don\u2019t worry. It won\u2019t suck the freshly made PCB away in a second. From my understanding, the milling work is a bit similar to laser cutting as below: At last, I got the first UPDI PCB, which is the fundamental layer for the next steps. A note: For absolute beginners, you might ask what UPDI means. According to onlinedocs.microchip , UPDI stands for \u201cUnified Program and Debug Interface\u201d. Basically, it is an interface (Microchip proprietary)to allow external programming and debugging of a device through the chips. In common language, it can be encoded from a \u201cmother\u201d language (it will appear later: SWD ), and used to program another chip (for example: to programme a blinking LED through Arduino). How to attach components on top of the PCB? \u00b6 In this part, Antti M\u00e4ntyniemi taught me how to solder the electronic components on top of the PCB. Antti J guided me on the practice. Stage 1 Get the needed components \u00b6 On 16 Feb 2002, Antti M gave me 6 components to observe and understand. I think those components are like LEGO. The critical components are: the 14-leg component. the 3-leg component. The less critical components are: the 4991-resistor x 2. the \u738b-shape component (with a cap). the \u5de5-shape component (with a cap). The components can be collected from a retotable shelf with small drawers (looks like a kebab oven). One note for absolute beginners: The caps can be lifted and removed\u2026 Stage 2 Let\u2019s solder \u00b6 The soldering work should be conducted in specific laboratory for electronics design. Luckily, there is one in FabLab. As a basic skill in electronics production, Soldering is a process to use a soldering iron (the pen) to melt the thin solder lines on top of the component legs to connect the components to the circuit board. The elements needed are as below: solder wires. It is quite soft and stretchable. It is metal alloy with flux inside which improves electrical contact and mechanical strength. It looks grey as the metal alloy powder contains Sn, Ag, Cu, and Bi. tape. Suggested by Antti M, it is important to know the professional ways to do something at the beginning. Before soldering, I used tapes to fix the PCB board on the table. desoldering braid. It looks like a brown ribbon. If there is too much soldering on the board, I can press the braid on the soldered joints, press and heat it with the soldering pen tip to let it absorb or extract the extra solder. Be careful of the braid\u2019s heat when working. abrasive. The copper surface on PCB plate can be oxidated, which looks dim. It is problematic as it may reject solder. So, an abrasive or brass sponge is useful to polish the copper surface by removing the oxidation. soldering iron stand with sponge. In my picture, I put the soldering iron pen on coil spring of the stand. Remember that the iron pen can be super hot which literally burns skin. Always insert the iron pen into the coil spring before doing other things. The sponge should be wet before soldering as you can wipe the hot pen to remove unnecessary solder. helping hand (can be creative). The logic is to magnify the working zone, which increases accuracy. It can be a magnifying glass, or this time as Antti M suggested, my IPhone placed on a pod using the magnifying glass function on the camera. Here the skill of coordination between eye observation through magnifying glass and hand work is critical which needs plenty of training. flux liquid (\u52a9\u710a\u5242). Flux is a useful chemical component to improve electrical contact and mechanical strength. In FabLab it used lead-free rosin core solder to make the work healthy. (40-50% rosin, 30% solvent, 5% rheology modifier, 2-5% activator). ventilation. Similar to laser cutting, when you melt the solder, there will be some smoke. It is a good habbit to turn the ventilation on to remove the smoke. Be careful not to let the tiny components be sipped away. The soldering iron pen is connected to a soldering station with different temperature settings powered by electricity. 350 \u2103 is recommended in most cases. Then, there are four steps for soldering (ideally, 4-5 seconds per joint): Heat up the soldering pen, press its tip to the joint area between the circuit board and leg of components. Wait for 1 second. Add solder: Press the solder wire to the iron tip to be melted a bit. Ideally, the grey fluid should flow around the tip as well as the joint part. Remove the solder wire, press the tip to the joint for 2-3 seconds. Remove the soldering pen to the soldering iron stand. Observe the joint part to make sure it is properly and stably connected. I observed Antti M\u2019s UPDI prototype then made my own. It helped me to better understand the \u201cpattern\u201d on the circuit board: Components are connected to the circuit board through legs which allow current and data transitions, laying the foundation for electronics design.

What is it used for? This sounds like a stupid question for engineering students, but it is still a basic question like \u201cWhat is scaffolding\u201d to outsiders of pedagogy, or \u201cdisenchantment\u201d to sociology starters. So, PCB(printed circuit board) looks like below. PCB industry started at the beginning of the 20th century. Bofore that, elctronic circuits were directly connected to each other in a point-to-point way, installed on a chassis. The circuits were heavy, large, bulky and expensive. From 1903, inventors including Albert Hanson, Thomas Edison, and Arthur Berry discovered that they could laminate flat copper layers (or foil ) on an insulating board, where conductors could be plated. The lines on the PCB board are called circuit traces or tracks . They can allow electricity to go through the components where programmes are installed. However, if it is a fresh board waiting to be used, like what I learned in the first week, it can be called a PWB (printed wiring board). In the following part, there are more key terms to keep in mind. Machine. The machine for the PCB milling in FabLab Oulu is Roland SRM-20. Of course, you have to set up parameters and run the machine from the connected desktop. Drill Drill literally means to dig a whole through a surface. In pedagogy, \u201cdrill\u201d is interpreted as practice. Antti M\u00e4ntyniemi started the introduction by asking me whether I know 3D printing. I said no. Then, he asked if I know x, y, z axis in spatial design. I said yes. Now it is easy to understand: drilling in electronics design means to move the machine tool up and down vertically. That is why drill deals with z axis. Mill Mill is not to make a house to grind grains into flour. In electronics design, mill means to move the tool horizonally , hence x and y axis are used. rectangular-bit or v-bit. When drilling and milling the PCB plate, the machine will use bit to realize the task. The 2 most frequently used bits are rectangular and V-shape (as below). When the PCB plate is perfectly flat, the rectangular bit leaves a milled track with the width to be 0.4mm, while the V-bit, depending on how deep it drills into the copper foil, makes the width ranging from 0.2-0.5 mm. When the PCB plate is curved, both bit shapes can create irregular milled tracks. It is quite abstract to talk about 0.2-0.5mm. So I used the vernier caliper to visualize the parameters. In FabLab Oulu, the most commonly used bits are rectangular style as below. PCB blank. The raw PCB working plate is called PCB blank. It has two layers. The lower part is a 1.6 mm plate; the upper surface is a 35\u03bcm copper foil (*1 mm = 1,000 \u03bcm). The PCB format I made this time was UPDI format. Sacrificial MDF bed. This is a thick plate to hold the PCB working plate. MDF is a common choice. This sacrificial bed surface needs to be polished and engraved after worn out. It is very important to know the thickness of PCB plate (e.g., in my assignment the thickness is 1.635mm .) because if you set the drill tool into the bed and mill, the tool can be easily broken. Isolation cutting","title":"Stage 1 Background knowledge for absolute beginners"},{"location":"assignments/week07/#stage-2-get-2-rml-files-the-inner-tracks-outline-for-milling","text":"In Stage 2, I will introduce how to set up two files to be milled: PCB traces (the body part) and outline (the shape) on https://mods.cba.mit.edu/. It looks quite scary at the first glance, but I marked the 6 main stepss to click and ignore at the same time. The purpose of the big picture is to set the necessary parameters including the size of the PCB, the milling (peeling) parts, the width and depth of traces. https://mods.cba.mit.edu/ allows FabLab Oulu users to set up parameters remotely through the big map above. What I did was to go to the website \u2192 right click the mouse \u2192 choose programm \u2192 choose open server program \u2192 choose Roland PCB svg (the final file format is .svg). step 1 delete the unnecessary window: the WebSocket device (press \u201cdelete\u201d). Then, right click the mouse in the empty place \u2192 choose file: save \u2192 get a new window named save file . Just leave it there at the moment. step 2 load 2 .svg file (PCB traces and outline) First, Antti gave me 2 pre-set .svg files for the PCB shape and body. The whole work generally consists of 2 sections: the traces/inner paths of PCB, and the outline or shape of the PCB (for example, in this work the shape is a regular USB). step 3 Invert the .svg files. Look at the left upper corner of the whole map, select the inner paths .SVG file. In the right window, click invert to redefine the zone to be removed. It is important to remember that, in PCB milling setting, the black parts will be removed by the tools. The white parts are the copper layers that connnect the components via currents. So unlike vinyl cutting, you definetely don\u2019t want to make the PCB functions inverted. step 4 Set PCB default. Without special intention, usually you don\u2019t have to change anything. Usually, you will just go on. step 5 Set the mill raster 2D parameters. This is a key step to get the \u201cmillable\u201d .rml files. Since a milled PCB consists of the traces and an outline, there will be 2 .rml files which require you to return from step 2 to step 5 to set up the outline svg file later. As you can see, the 2D mill file is basically a raster file which considers pixels rather than lines. The tool diameter determines the copper zones to be removed. The bigger the tool diameter is, the more copper surface will be removed. The cut depth defines how deep the tool will go into the board. Antti shared his experience of the three parameters: the diameter to be 0.3 mm; the cut depth as 0.07 mm (It is interesting as the thickness of copper layer is 35 \u03bcm (0.035 mm), so 0.07 mm doubles the thickness, allowing the 2 depth settings to be equal.

Embedded programming \u00b6 With the basic knowledge of PCB and soldering, this week I continued the electronics courses taught by Antti M\u00e4ntyniemi for embedded programming on a STDI chip. The learning objective is to produce a programmed STDI PCB board with an LED controlled by a button. The functions of LED and the button shall be programmmed. I guess this is the foundation for Input design. This time the course is a typical engineering style: use a professional software (KiCad) to design the work, then realise it with computer-controlled machine (LPKF ProtoMat S62). Based on the prior knowledg of PCB, Antti M used reverse engineering to teach. He made me observe a prototype of final PCB work, and guided me to think, disassemble the process of realisation backwards. Below is target work of schematic: as well as the target work of PCB: Research \u00b6 The use of fablab treasure box \u00b6 One of the most important things for independent study is to find the right resources. Antti used the Fablab course material website which I found significant as I can find all necessary stuff recognised by Fablab. Some basic or updated knowledge \u00b6 the terms \u00b6 embedded programming : to use microcontrollers as the savers for specific programming. For example, the reason why smartphones and electronic devices can be \u201csmart\u201d is that engineers programme certain functions and store them in the microcontrollers (usually known as chips) to allow users to interact. pin : the \u201cleg\u201d of electric components. capacitor : It can store electrical energy from some resources like battery. The difference is that, batteries store energy chemically, while capacitors realise it physically. GND : abbreviation for \u201cground\u201d, which serves to be a common return path for electric current. The relation between PCB and electronic schematic \u00b6 PCB stands for printed circuit board. The board is a physical representation of schematic that can be understood as the \u201clogic\u201d or \u201csoul\u201d of the board. By programming the component functions in schematic, you can define the connections of the pins as well as the workflows of the PCB. Procedure \u00b6 Use KiCad to set 2 printable files \u00b6 For this step, we used KiCad as the software to design the schematic. Below is the interface of Kicad. Set up the KiCad Libraries \u00b6 Open a new schematic file. An important feature of embedded programming is that you do NOT have to scratch from the surface, but can directly search for the needed items in the digital libraries. To realise it, open KiCad. You have to install required libraries (for example: fab contains 17,241 items). Luckily, they have all been properly set in the desktops of Fablab Oulu. Find proper Items(components) \u00b6 The needed items are: microcontroller (Microcontroller_ATtiny412_SSFR) pinheader (Conne_Pinheader_SMD (pinheader is the \u201cneedle\u201d while socket is the \u201creceiver\u201d)) capacitor (C) LED resistor (R) button (BUTTON_B35N) Below are the items in the library: They are shown in the schematic as below: Then, add 3 VCC and 6 GND . Draw lines to link the items \u00b6 This steps is to give items electronic connections in a logical flow. To do so, you need to draw lines between different pins. Below is the prototype: This is a quite straightforward step: It takes patience and focus, but I got the work as below: Tips for debugging \u00b6 If you are unsure whether you have properly connected all the pins, don\u2019t worry. You can use Annotate Schematic to run Electrical Rules Checker . It allows you to see if there are some errors related to the schematic design. For example, when I checked my design, there were 4 errors. The first 2 told me that 2 microcontroller input pins were not driven by output power pins; the latter 2 informed that there were 2 connector pinheaders unconnected. KiCad smartly marked the problematic pinheads (CTS and RTS). After justification, I decided not to use the 2 pinheaders then, so found the x on the right to \u201cseal\u201d them. When I run the Electrical Rules Checker again, the 2 pinheader errors were closed. To solve the microcontroller input/output erros, I added 2 power flag item from the library. This item tells ERC where power comes from. In this practice, one PWR flag links to GND, another to VCC. Now, you can see that all the errors were solved. To do it more professional, you can assign footprints to the key items in your schematic design. Solve the rats\u2019 nest PCB puzzle \u00b6 The next step is like solving a Lego puzzle. In fact, I just finished the first layer (schematic design), but need to make an equivalent PCB design. By opening the PCB Editor , you will assemble the mock-up components that are ready for later PCB making. Yeah. At first, it literally IS a mess, which is why another name of it is the rats\u2019 nest . To be honest, this step is quite relaxing. I opened my laptop to show the prototype schematic, and dragged the items on my working desktop to their proper places. Add a filled zone to the schematic \u00b6 It is meaningful to review the prototype again for absolute beginners (me). The red part looks bloody, but they are the copper part of the PCB. You can see that all the pins are marked with copper rectangles because they really have to. First, you need to define an outline of the PCB work. Find Edge Cuts in Appearance to draw the outline. Then, select F.CU to draw the copper paths between pins following the white straight lines that are actually the lines in schematic design. During this process, I happened to debug the mistakes in the previous step. I clicked DRC control to see 2 types of errors. The are shown in the violations and you can easily locate them as they are marked. First, the button (on the left upper corner) was displaced upside down where the 2 GND should have been on the top. Second, there are 3 paths unconnected. The silkscreen can be understood as the words printed on the PCB. If it requires high level of criticality, then it is better to avoid overlapping words. Otherwise, you can ignore those violations. Then, use F.Cu to draw a slightly inner outline for of the PCB. Then, change from mm to mil on the left, open Copper Zone Properties , click F.Cu and select GND in the Net. Then, define the Clearance and Minimum width in Electrical Properties. A moderate number in the practice was 10 mils, but of course you can try other parameters to preview by clicking OK. After clicking OK, you can see that the PCB is filled with red, copper zone. It gives me an impression that the schematic is a set of skeleton, while PCB editor and filling is to enflesh the design. Generate gerber files (.gbr) \u00b6 Similar to Roland PCB practice, there are 2 gerber files to generate: The outline (Edge_Cuts.gbr)and the inner body (F_Cu.gbr). To do so, open Plot , click F.Cu and Edge.Cuts in the Layers . Then, choose plot to get the 2 files. Use ProtoMat S62 to mill it out \u00b6 The PCB milling steps are very straightfoward. LPKF ProtoMat S62 can run the work automatically as long as you set up the parameters on the connected desktop well. Luckily, the controlling software is very smart to use. Set up the machine \u00b6 Open the lid of LPKF and you will see four main parts that are critical. There are 10 milling tools that can be maintained or replaced. This is the working board, or in Roland machine, the sacrificial bed. It is replacable. It is better to be set in the board and stablised by using tapes around. This is the tube to allow air flow beneath the working board to tightly attach it to the bed. This is the working hand for the milling and driling work. If you take a closer look at the working hand, there are 2 parts that are significant. a. You do not have to set up milling tools manually. It moves to the right seat of tool then install or uninstall the tool smartly. The black cover can prevent the tool go too close to the working surface. b.

You can use Annotate Schematic to run Electrical Rules Checker . It allows you to see if there are some errors related to the schematic design. For example, when I checked my design, there were 4 errors. The first 2 told me that 2 microcontroller input pins were not driven by output power pins; the latter 2 informed that there were 2 connector pinheaders unconnected. KiCad smartly marked the problematic pinheads (CTS and RTS). After justification, I decided not to use the 2 pinheaders then, so found the x on the right to \u201cseal\u201d them. When I run the Electrical Rules Checker again, the 2 pinheader errors were closed. To solve the microcontroller input/output erros, I added 2 power flag item from the library. This item tells ERC where power comes from. In this practice, one PWR flag links to GND, another to VCC. Now, you can see that all the errors were solved. To do it more professional, you can assign footprints to the key items in your schematic design.","title":"Tips for debugging"},{"location":"assignments/week09/#solve-the-rats-nest-pcb-puzzle","text":"The next step is like solving a Lego puzzle.

The red part looks bloody, but they are the copper part of the PCB. You can see that all the pins are marked with copper rectangles because they really have to. First, you need to define an outline of the PCB work. Find Edge Cuts in Appearance to draw the outline. Then, select F.CU to draw the copper paths between pins following the white straight lines that are actually the lines in schematic design. During this process, I happened to debug the mistakes in the previous step. I clicked DRC control to see 2 types of errors. The are shown in the violations and you can easily locate them as they are marked. First, the button (on the left upper corner) was displaced upside down where the 2 GND should have been on the top. Second, there are 3 paths unconnected. The silkscreen can be understood as the words printed on the PCB. If it requires high level of criticality, then it is better to avoid overlapping words. Otherwise, you can ignore those violations. Then, use F.Cu to draw a slightly inner outline for of the PCB. Then, change from mm to mil on the left, open Copper Zone Properties , click F.Cu and select GND in the Net. Then, define the Clearance and Minimum width in Electrical Properties. A moderate number in the practice was 10 mils, but of course you can try other parameters to preview by clicking OK. After clicking OK, you can see that the PCB is filled with red, copper zone.

Invention, intellectual property and income \u00b6 This week Megumi gave us basic ideas of patent, copyright, intellectual properties, and commercial values of our final projects. She also encouraged us to share our ideas or drafts of the final project, comment and give \u201c3 star 1 wish\u201d suggestions to help each other realize them. To me, even the final project may take longer time to achieve due to the changing agenda, it is meaningful to digest Neil\u2019s video and Megumi\u2019s knowledge in a practical scenario. Research on the topic \u00b6 In Neil\u2019s elaboration, patent refers to inventions of a \u201cmatter\u201d as well as the improvements to them. It does not give the inventors an automatic exemption from the being stolen or cheated, but only a name-printed, regional admission ticket into legal system if unfortunate things happen, never to say the expenses that will follow to defend the legal rights. Patent may sound rather professional and rigid, but in fact they must be novel, useful and not obvious. In daily language, those who are fake, cheating, against the principle of nature or human societies will not be acknowledged and hence patented. Below is the patent of a certain type of bike. Copyright is to acknowledge the authorship and originality of intellectual works, especially art and academic creations such as books, articles, paintings, musical products. If you own a copyright of a song, you can decide its distribution and usage of the work. For instance, one day I wrote a cheesy song but it suddenly became a hit in China, I could charge for the karaoke bars each time they use my song (of course their business is partially based on the songs). Or I typed a critical essay about Chinese education system. If some media wish to reprint it via website or H5 pages, they must inform me to get approved, or more formally, with inform consent. For example, most artists choose to publish their works in Spotify where users could only listen to the music instantly but cannot download them to have certain \u201cownership\u201d of the music work. Trademark is easier to understand. As an institute grows, ther might be more and more products and research. Hence, the trademark is like the \u201cface\u201d of a company, a product, or a design, when showing to the public. For example, Nitendo can use its trademark when doing business with other parties no matther it is about the Switch machine, Super Mario game series, or the cosplay permission of Legend of Zelda. Project Draft \u00b6 presentation slide \u00b6 presentation slide presentation video \u00b6 presentation video Elaboration \u00b6 In the first demo, I hope to realize in MDF board with laser cutter. It is not just because I need to evidence the learning of computer controlled cutting in FabLab, but also I hope to make the bag a bit fun. It can be used as a container not for books or laptop, but for small items or a box of snacks. The glittering parts will be installed on left and right sides. I plan to cut some shapes that allow LED lights to be inserted and controlled by an electric sensor. I used red lines to mark the challgening parts so far. There will be a joint plate which includes the back, top and upper-top sides. At the same time, I need to think about where to install the handle. If it is on the top, should there be holes to allow the handle to go through? Also, the upper front side should be bigger, presumably a trapezoid with round corners, to cover the front. When it comes to lock, I plan to use vintage style: cross-locking. To realize it, I need to cut a small slot and consult the instructors from handicrafts. Since the whole bag is a variation of laser cut box with hinge, I need to justify the stability of the jigsaw hinges by tesing different interlocking designs. Possible target users \u00b6 This is literally my first experience in FabLab so there are plenty of rules and information to study and digest, including the final project design. My worklfow was straightforward: Use imagination to combine the freshly acquired engineering and digital fabrication skills with the local society to see where I can start. It does not have to be perfect or so profound as the project can save the world, but it is healthy to make functions public to welcome different comments and suggestions to refine it together in a constructive sense. Of course, during the process, the knowledge of intellectual properties including patent, copyright and trademarks, can effectively protect me from being overkind at the beginning, and depressed when infringed. In this regard, I hope to design a wooden bag used in winter Finland. The users can be any person, but I can start the promotion in among student groups. After living here for more than one year, no one would denounce that it is dark from November to January, regardless of the astounding polar lights shining occassionally. I noticed that people are advised to hang glittering items (official name: safety reflector ) to their rucksacks to avoid being bumped away by innocent cyclists or car drivers. I find the safety reflectors a bit insufficient as they totally rely on the given lights or attention from the coming persons. To deal with it, I hope to make the bag shine by itself. Any plan to start business with the project? \u00b6 I am not very ambitious in business but it would be very encouraging if someone offers a bid. At least I would have financial incentives to move on. If my bag can be used in local schools, the business is rewarding. Types \u00b6 I would start from the idea of hybrid mode as it allows more perspectives. This bag can be first introduced to schools in a non-profitable way. As it is wooden, students can put small items in it and carry like a small lattern walking on the snowy, dark and cold winter lanes. The school budget can of course cover the purchase. If students use the bag well, it can be spread to their parents as well as school staff. In this regard, the business can take profit into consideration. The materials of the bag can be flexible with wood, acrylic, or traditional fashion fabrics such as leather and wools. Additional decorations can be customised including the lock, the shape of LED lights, the engraved patterns on the surface. Vinyl stickers are also available. If possible, the bag can try fasion collaborations with big IPs like Moomin. Funding \u00b6 For this humble design, I hope to start from family and friends\u2019 merit funding, say hundreds of euros to do demo test, to cover the transport and canteen fee in school visits, or the coffee bills when persuading neigbors or friends to buy a demo bag. If it can survive after the first year with a quantity demand more than 100, I can learn to expose it to cloud-funding or negotiate purchase commitment with some factories. Which copyright licenses will I consider and choose? Why? \u00b6 Instead of making a decision on which licenses I will choose under the pressure of FabLab weekly assignment and apparently my project is still in the air, I would rather be empty-minded to learn what usual licenses are existing. After studying open-source vs free, Creative Commons, and Apache, I would like to use fab as the the licensing. Instead of flashy and ornate terms, the brief description of Fablab and Neil\u2019s frankness: My FB work \u201cmay be reproduced, modified, distributed, performed, and displayed for any purpose, but must acknowledge \u201cproject name\u201d. Copyright is retained and must be preserved. The work is provided as is; no warranty is provided, and users accept all liability.\u201d Why not? It\u2019s a good platform. I am glad that people from different background to help me improve the design. \u00b6 How about the patent? \u00b6 As I mentioned above, before choosing a patent, or whether to patent something, it is essential to equip myself with the notion, or more practically, the legal significance of patent. China witnessed the developement of the notion of IP. Most people used to have rare sense of intellectual properties, assuming that they can use whatever they find from the internet or media. When music companies such as Sony and some famous singers like Jay Chow forbade people from free downloading, there were huge debates among netizens, some of which blamed them for being so mean and selfish. This misunderstanding has been well solved by progressive education and juridical judgements in the past decade. After studying Espacenet, Google Patents, and Patent Inspiration, I choose NOT to patent my bag at least for a long term. My initial purpose was to start from students or common folks, which is with strong non-profit feature.I believe the users can help me build up better versions of the bag. In other word, I would rather DONATE it to the society. I do have 2 idols who have extraordinarily successful products but have not claimed them to be exclusive: \u6771\u65b9Project\uff0f\u3068\u3046\u307b\u3046\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8 accompanied my childhood. ZUN, its author, chose to make the whole series including all the elements to be open sources. This went so well with the fans communities as they worked together to extend the whole project to an unbelievable scale covering cosplay, hobby products, manga, re-creation, etc. which are full of imagination. https://www.irasutoya.com/ The owner of the cute and amazing website has never shown its real face to the public, but has been constantly creating beautiful illustrations to be publicly used around the world, which have been totally free. Some design houses hate it so much due to the fear of unemployment. In a serious stance, open sources is a democratic power to fight against monopolies so there must be space for unpatentness. I do not believe magnates such as Nitendo, Tencent, or Microsoft whose main incentives are shaped by VCs, can have the patience or interests to make quality games like one of my favorites - Disco Elysium .","title":"19.

Invention, intellectual property and income"},{"location":"assignments/week19/#research-on-the-topic","text":"In Neil\u2019s elaboration, patent refers to inventions of a \u201cmatter\u201d as well as the improvements to them. It does not give the inventors an automatic exemption from the being stolen or cheated, but only a name-printed, regional admission ticket into legal system if unfortunate things happen, never to say the expenses that will follow to defend the legal rights. Patent may sound rather professional and rigid, but in fact they must be novel, useful and not obvious. In daily language, those who are fake, cheating, against the principle of nature or human societies will not be acknowledged and hence patented. Below is the patent of a certain type of bike. Copyright is to acknowledge the authorship and originality of intellectual works, especially art and academic creations such as books, articles, paintings, musical products. If you own a copyright of a song, you can decide its distribution and usage of the work. For instance, one day I wrote a cheesy song but it suddenly became a hit in China, I could charge for the karaoke bars each time they use my song (of course their business is partially based on the songs). Or I typed a critical essay about Chinese education system. If some media wish to reprint it via website or H5 pages, they must inform me to get approved, or more formally, with inform consent. For example, most artists choose to publish their works in Spotify where users could only listen to the music instantly but cannot download them to have certain \u201cownership\u201d of the music work. Trademark is easier to understand. As an institute grows, ther might be more and more products and research. Hence, the trademark is like the \u201cface\u201d of a company, a product, or a design, when showing to the public. For example, Nitendo can use its trademark when doing business with other parties no matther it is about the Switch machine, Super Mario game series, or the cosplay permission of Legend of Zelda.","title":"Research on the topic"},{"location":"assignments/week19/#project-draft","text":"","title":"Project Draft"},{"location":"assignments/week19/#presentation-slide","text":"presentation slide","title":"presentation slide"},{"location":"assignments/week19/#presentation-video","text":"presentation video","title":"presentation video"},{"location":"assignments/week19/#elaboration","text":"In the first demo, I hope to realize in MDF board with laser cutter. It is not just because I need to evidence the learning of computer controlled cutting in FabLab, but also I hope to make the bag a bit fun. It can be used as a container not for books or laptop, but for small items or a box of snacks. The glittering parts will be installed on left and right sides. I plan to cut some shapes that allow LED lights to be inserted and controlled by an electric sensor. I used red lines to mark the challgening parts so far. There will be a joint plate which includes the back, top and upper-top sides. At the same time, I need to think about where to install the handle. If it is on the top, should there be holes to allow the handle to go through? Also, the upper front side should be bigger, presumably a trapezoid with round corners, to cover the front. When it comes to lock, I plan to use vintage style: cross-locking. To realize it, I need to cut a small slot and consult the instructors from handicrafts. Since the whole bag is a variation of laser cut box with hinge, I need to justify the stability of the jigsaw hinges by tesing different interlocking designs.","title":"Elaboration"},{"location":"assignments/week19/#possible-target-users","text":"This is literally my first experience in FabLab so there are plenty of rules and information to study and digest, including the final project design. My worklfow was straightforward: Use imagination to combine the freshly acquired engineering and digital fabrication skills with the local society to see where I can start. It does not have to be perfect or so profound as the project can save the world, but it is healthy to make functions public to welcome different comments and suggestions to refine it together in a constructive sense. Of course, during the process, the knowledge of intellectual properties including patent, copyright and trademarks, can effectively protect me from being overkind at the beginning, and depressed when infringed. In this regard, I hope to design a wooden bag used in winter Finland. The users can be any person, but I can start the promotion in among student groups. After living here for more than one year, no one would denounce that it is dark from November to January, regardless of the astounding polar lights shining occassionally. I noticed that people are advised to hang glittering items (official name: safety reflector ) to their rucksacks to avoid being bumped away by innocent cyclists or car drivers. I find the safety reflectors a bit insufficient as they totally rely on the given lights or attention from the coming persons. To deal with it, I hope to make the bag shine by itself.","title":"Possible target users"},{"location":"assignments/week19/#any-plan-to-start-business-with-the-project","text":"I am not very ambitious in business but it would be very encouraging if someone offers a bid. At least I would have financial incentives to move on. If my bag can be used in local schools, the business is rewarding.","title":"Any plan to start business with the project?"},{"location":"assignments/week19/#types","text":"I would start from the idea of hybrid mode as it allows more perspectives. This bag can be first introduced to schools in a non-profitable way. As it is wooden, students can put small items in it and carry like a small lattern walking on the snowy, dark and cold winter lanes. The school budget can of course cover the purchase. If students use the bag well, it can be spread to their parents as well as school staff. In this regard, the business can take profit into consideration. The materials of the bag can be flexible with wood, acrylic, or traditional fashion fabrics such as leather and wools. Additional decorations can be customised including the lock, the shape of LED lights, the engraved patterns on the surface. Vinyl stickers are also available. If possible, the bag can try fasion collaborations with big IPs like Moomin.","title":"Types"},{"location":"assignments/week19/#funding","text":"For this humble design, I hope to start from family and friends\u2019 merit funding, say hundreds of euros to do demo test, to cover the transport and canteen fee in school visits, or the coffee bills when persuading neigbors or friends to buy a demo bag. If it can survive after the first year with a quantity demand more than 100, I can learn to expose it to cloud-funding or negotiate purchase commitment with some factories.","title":"Funding"},{"location":"assignments/week19/#which-copyright-licenses-will-i-consider-and-choose-why","text":"Instead of making a decision on which licenses I will choose under the pressure of FabLab weekly assignment and apparently my project is still in the air, I would rather be empty-minded to learn what usual licenses are existing. After studying open-source vs free, Creative Commons, and Apache, I would like to use fab as the the licensing.

I am glad that people from different background to help me improve the design."},{"location":"assignments/week19/#how-about-the-patent","text":"As I mentioned above, before choosing a patent, or whether to patent something, it is essential to equip myself with the notion, or more practically, the legal significance of patent. China witnessed the developement of the notion of IP. Most people used to have rare sense of intellectual properties, assuming that they can use whatever they find from the internet or media. When music companies such as Sony and some famous singers like Jay Chow forbade people from free downloading, there were huge debates among netizens, some of which blamed them for being so mean and selfish. This misunderstanding has been well solved by progressive education and juridical judgements in the past decade. After studying Espacenet, Google Patents, and Patent Inspiration, I choose NOT to patent my bag at least for a long term. My initial purpose was to start from students or common folks, which is with strong non-profit feature.I believe the users can help me build up better versions of the bag. In other word, I would rather DONATE it to the society. I do have 2 idols who have extraordinarily successful products but have not claimed them to be exclusive: \u6771\u65b9Project\uff0f\u3068\u3046\u307b\u3046\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8 accompanied my childhood. ZUN, its author, chose to make the whole series including all the elements to be open sources. This went so well with the fans communities as they worked together to extend the whole project to an unbelievable scale covering cosplay, hobby products, manga, re-creation, etc. which are full of imagination. https://www.irasutoya.com/ The owner of the cute and amazing website has never shown its real face to the public, but has been constantly creating beautiful illustrations to be publicly used around the world, which have been totally free. Some design houses hate it so much due to the fear of unemployment. In a serious stance, open sources is a democratic power to fight against monopolies so there must be space for unpatentness. I do not believe magnates such as Nitendo, Tencent, or Microsoft whose main incentives are shaped by VCs, can have the patience or interests to make quality games like one of my favorites - Disco Elysium .","title":"How about the patent?"},{"location":"assignments/week20/","text":"20.
