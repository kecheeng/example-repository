I am Kecheng Zhang from China. I am a master student of Learning, Education and Technology in the University of Oulu. I like to play RPGs, do free reading, experiencing and creating interesting things. However, I don\u2019t like cooking. I have lived, studied and worked in Beijing, Hong Kong, Madrid, and have travelled around many EU cities. My background \u00b6 I was born in Chengdu, the hometown of giant panda bears, the hot pot, and spicy Sichuan Chinese food. Located in southwest China, it is the regional metropolis with a population of over 20 million. Away from stereotypical Confucianism, people prefer a relaxing, humorous life, just like its mild climate (only 300 cloudy days a year), the outdoor teahouses, the dynamic nightclubs, the bookstores, the misty bamboo forests, and other Taoist and Buddhist influences. Previous work \u00b6 I was a trained teacher for high school and K-12 education, and hope to continue to work in this field with a broader understanding of education, as well as more technologies. This is my first time programming. Final Project \u00b6 In the final project, I hope to design and realize a wooden handbag or a schoolbag used for Finnish winter. Finnish winter is cold and dark. People need to hang small lights or reflective bandages to their clothes or bagpacks to remind drivers. In my project, I hope to use laser cutter to get the main body of the wooden bag. I will engrave some holes at certain sides of the wood bag, allowing to insert LED lights controlled by electronic sensors. One of the challenging parts is to bend the back + head + front side. Meanwhile, this bag needs to have a balance between functionality and fashion.","title":"About me"},{"location":"about/#about-me","text":"Hi! I am Kecheng Zhang from China.

Principles and practices \u00b6 Now I can finally push all the assignments to the github. To me, joining FabLab courses is both a spontaneous and yuan fen\u7f18\u5206 event. Last year, I stepped into FabLab because I needed to design and print a board game and later a robot body through laser cutter. That was professor Jari Laru\u2019s introductory course for Technology and Education. The philosophy of that course, from my understanding, is computational thinking. Everyone was filled with several courses, which apparently left very little time to study tons of new technologies. I justified that instead of using hours to start from zero, why not learn the skills from the experts? So, with natural ways of communication, I consulted Mekko, Ivan and Behnaz for the basic questions. They were all very patient and good at scaffolding. I tried to use pencil sketches to define the engineering parts, expecting some softwares to draw them. Then, I observed the experts\u2019 procedure of realization, asked them the key steps then took notes. Sometimes I also asked the logics or mechanisms behind the crucial steps. They somehow taught me how to manage time well: software design + machine setting + demo printing + doing other projects or discussion/review. On crucial steps, such as parameter setting, laser printer setting, monitoring, and reviewing, they would let me realize them. As a teacher, I totally agree on this: scaffolding is to encourage students to try, but not take hand to do their assignment. For sure, I made some mistakes when printing. I was not frustrated, but concentrated on where I went wrong. Was it because of carelessness, or the lost information of some key steps. After rounds of trial and error, I could finally realize the board game as well as the robot body. From that point, I gradually felt the charm of engineering and hands-on/maker education: Engineering things don\u2019t lie or just use mouths to intepret. Rather, you MUST exactly show the skills you learned. Even though people can have crazy imagination, you still have to realize it step by step, with patience and problem-solving skills. Also, learning from the experts does not mean copying and cheating, you still have to elaborate how you achieve the final results. As a teacher who mainly has social sciences background, I need such engineering methodology. And I don\u2019t regret my choice, no matter how challenging the FabLab tasks can be.

Computer Aided design \u00b6 Research \u00b6 To design and study the raster and vector files, this time I tried Inkscape for 2D, and Fusion360 for 3D, both of which were totally new to me. It took me around 10 days to get used to their basic functions, during which I regulated my emotion, motivation, as well as the cognitive strategies to learn them. Professional and scary as they may be, they can be unbelievably convenient once knowing the logic and mechanisms of the complexity behind them. Gallery + Elaboration \u00b6 1. 2D Raster and Vector: Inkscape \u00b6 This is the 2nd pencil draft of the wooden bag for the final project. As an amateur, I studied thingiverse.com to get inspirations of the wooden box files with their svg files. I defined the parts that need modifications such as the flat bottom, interlocking designs, holes to allow the handle, and the trapezoid front-upper side. The measurement is crucial in Inkscape design. I got the parameters including slot width and depth. I used eraser function to weed off the unnecessary parts, then closed the side with a straight line. For the residuals, I used white rectangular blocks to cover. After the trial, I could focus more on the technical parts for the coming laser cutting: the round corners, the bendable top, etc. So, I used the 3rd pencil draft to help illustrate. After the modification, I still need to change the line width to 0.02 mm for laser cutting, redesign the trapezoid lines, justify the jigsaw teeth interlocking designs, and take kerf into consideration. 2. 3D Raster and Vector: Fusion360 \u00b6 I met some problems using Fusion360 during the week mostly because I felt hesitant and scared of new software. I was anxious about the functions or unfamiliar keyboard combinations of Fusion360, just like when I started to programme at CMD, or Inkscape, or generally speaking, anything new including some classic RPGs such as Neverwinter Night, the Elder Scroll, etc. or living in a new country. It is more about personality. So, I tried to dodge Fusion360, but when it came to Behnaz\u2019s week for computer-controlled cutting, I must face it as Inkscape is smart except for one thing: parametric design! Therefore, I returned to this week\u2019s task then located the function of learning Fusion360 as to understand and try parametric designs. After hours of nervous attempt, I practised designing a pentagon with sloths. Since this assignment was completed after week 4\u2019s content, I had already got the knowledge of kerf, so would directly post the portfolio here.","title":"3.

Computer controlled cutting \u00b6 This week Behnaz taught us how to use vinyl cutter and laser cutter. To get a svg file, the simplest way is to practise using Inkscape. This time, I had to force myself to use Fusion 360 to do parametric design before transfering it to an svg file. Fusion 360 is inescapable as Inkscape is powerful only except for parametric design. Research \u00b6 The toughest part was the usage of fusion360. At first, I was afraid of the new, professional software but with the encouragement from Antti, Diep, and Behnaz, I calmed down, watched Neil\u2019s intro video, youtube tutorials, and some Chinese geeks\u2019 clips. After a good sleep, I opened fusion360, randomly drew a pentagon, tried some constraints, clicked here and there to explore the parameter setting window before it accidentally worked! The same feeling took place again, which was just like those for Github programming as well as Inkscape. I could literally feel the convenience of parametric design and the reason to use it over Inkscape.

Gallery + Elaboration \u00b6 1. vinyl cutting \u00b6 observation and practice \u00b6 Starting from a basic Inkscape pattern, it is a good habit to also draw a frame for the convenience of later weeding. Weeding, according to Neil\u2019s video, means peeling the unnecessary parts. Ctrl + Shift + R can allow me to resize page to drawing or selection in Document Properties. To open or close the Roland vinyl cutter, push the handle at the left back side. Then, the two wheels can be lifted. It is a must to place the vinyl paper between the two wheels. The wheels must also be within the white label ranges in order to be detectable by the machine. If you want to get a more precise measurement of the vinyl paper, you can press preference in printing window, then click \u201cGet from Machine\u201d. This allows the scanner of the vinyl cutter to horizontally run across the vinyl paper. To transfer the svg file to Roland vinyl cutter, find Roland CutStudio in Extensions, then press \u201cOpen\u201d. It is advisable to select \u201cEdge\u201d in Sheet category. Here we go. A note: the size of the vinyl paper should be moderate. Avoid thin one. Importantly, the most obvious difference between vinyl and laser cutter is that vinyl cutter literally uses sharp knife to press on the material to get the lines. The most standarized way to weed (peel) the usable sticker is to use tweezer, especially when there are exquisite spots or lines. Of course, if they were just basic patterns, or to make the lessons more attractive to youngsters, fingers and hands are parallelly flexible tools. Transferring sheets are powerful if you want to save the cut work for later use. The tough side of vinyl paper is slippery, allowing transferring sheet to attach them tightly. After this procedure, you can get both the stikers and transferring sheets to show the sticky sides. Be careful of the dusts, of course. The end of observation and practice session. Quite straightforward experience. The frame is an important part to allow convenient weeding. Also, it helps to justify positive and negative patterns as later I encountered when doing my own giant panda printing practice. self design and final work \u00b6 Without much talk, I got a panda bear svg file from the Internet, added a frame in Inkscape, exported it to Roland Cutstudio, made 3 sizes, then set up the cutter (mode: edge) as in the observation session. I used black vinyl as panda bear fur is a combination of white and black. When it came to weeding (peeling), Diep asked about how to define which parts to leave. To be honest, I had the same concern the day before. My friend who knows seal cutting comforted me that it is my justification of positive and negative effects. Therefore, you can see that on the left side, the little pattern was the residual that I didnt need simply because I knew the color distribution of panda. Also, as you can see, the larger the sticker is (mine largest size was 70mm), the easier to weed and to allow more complicated line designs. After weeding, I got the stickers I needed. How to transfer them? Transfering sheet was helpful. Press it hard to the work, lift then get the usable stickers. Be careful since the panda show their skicky sides to me. The final work looks great. The sticky side was quite strong. Also, the rough side seems durable. 2. laser cutting \u00b6 observation and practice \u00b6 self design and final work \u00b6","title":"4.
