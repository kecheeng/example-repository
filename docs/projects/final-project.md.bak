# Final Project
In this course, I want to mainly use laser cutter to make a wooden bag with LED lights controlled by electronic sensors. It can be used in Finnish winter to protect users from cars and bikes.

## Research
To realize this project, I devide the tasks into two branches: software design + physical realization
  The software design includes:
     *Inkscape design: 2D vector - shapes, bitmap tracing, subtracting, aligning 
     *svg template file study: kerf parameter setting + design, interlocking design
	 *fusion 360: build a 3D vector to better illustrate my project
	 *ImageMagick: to review the rasters
	 *Roland cutstudio: Inkscape + Roland cutstudio = vinyl cutting in case I need extra stickers to reflect lights or for decoration.

## 2D and 3D Modeling

After studying the svg templates from thingiverse.com, I defined my Inkscape svg drafts.
