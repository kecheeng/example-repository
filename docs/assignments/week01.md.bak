# 1. Principles and practices

<d>Now I can finally push all the assignments to the github. To me, joining FabLab courses is both a spontaneous and yuan fen缘分 event.</d>
<d>Last year, I stepped into FabLab because I needed to design and print a board game and later a robot body through laser cutter.</d>
<d>That was professor Jari Laru's introductory course for Technology and Education. The philosophy of that course, from my understanding, is computational thinking.</d>
<d>Everyone was filled with several courses, which apparently left very little time to study tons of new technologies. I justified that instead of using hours to start from zero, why not learn the skills from the experts? So, with natural ways of communication, I consulted Mekko, Ivan and Behnaz for the basic questions.
They were all very patient and good at scaffolding. I tried to use pencil sketches to define the engineering parts, expecting some softwares to draw them. Then, I observed the experts' procedure of realization, asked them the key steps then took notes. Sometimes I also asked the logics or mechanisms behind the crucial steps.</d> 
They somehow taught me how to manage time well: software design + machine setting + demo printing + doing other projects or discussion/review.
On crucial steps, such as parameter setting, laser printer setting, monitoring, and reviewing, they would let me realize them. As a teacher, I totally agree on this: scaffolding is to encourage students to try, but not take hand to do their assignment. 
For sure, I made some mistakes when printing. I was not frustrated, but concentrated on where I went wrong. Was it because of carelessness, or the lost information of some key steps.
After rounds of trial and error, I could finally realize the board game as well as the robot body. 
From that point, I gradually felt the charm of engineering and hands-on/maker education: Engineering things don't lie or just use mouths to intepret. Rather, you MUST exactly show the skills you learned. Even though people can have crazy imagination, you still have to realize it step by step, with patience and problem-solving skills. Also, learning from the experts does not mean copying and cheating, you still have to elaborate how you achieve the final results.
As a teacher who mainly has social sciences background, I need such engineering methodology.
And I don't regret my choice, no matter how challenging the FabLab tasks can be.
