# 19. Invention, intellectual property and income

This week Megumi gave us basic ideas of patent, copyright, intellectual properties, and commercial values of our final projects. She also encouraged us to share our ideas or drafts of the final project, comment and give "3 star 1 wish" suggestions to help each other realize them. To me, even the final project may take longer time to achieve due to the changing agenda, it is meaningful to digest Neil's video and Megumi's knowledge in a practical scenario.

## Research
This is literally my first first contact with FabLab so there are plenty of rules and information to study and digest, including the final project design. My worklfow was straightforward: Use imagination to combine the freshly acquired engineering and digital fabrication skills with the local society to see where I can start. It does not have to be perfect or so profound as the project can save the world, but it is healthy to make functions public to welcome different comments and suggestions to refine it together in a constructive sense. Of course, during the process, the knowledge of intellectual properties including patent, copyright and trademarks, can effectively protect me from being overkind at the beginning, and depressed when infringed. 
In this regard,
