<h1 id="4-computer-controlled-cutting">4. Computer controlled cutting<a class="headerlink" href="#4-computer-controlled-cutting" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>This week Behnaz taught us computer controlled cutting using examples of <strong>vinyl cutter</strong> and <strong>laser cutter</strong>.  </p>
<p>To get a <strong>.svg</strong> file, the simplest way is to design on <strong>Inkscape</strong>. For <strong>parametric designs</strong>, I used <strong>Fusion 360</strong> exporting and transfering it to pdf format. Fusion 360 is inescapable as Inkscape is powerful only except for parametric design. </p>
<h2 id="research">Research<a class="headerlink" href="#research" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Some key notion to keep in mind:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Vinyl cutting: .svg file + Roland CAMM 1 GS-24 vinyl cutter (real knife cut).  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Laser cutting: .pdf file + Laser cutter (Epilog Laser Fusion cutters, CO2 laser beam cut)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>raster-for engraving, which is about dots, pixels;  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>vector-for cutting, which is about lines, flames (as more beam power is focused).  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The toughest part was the usage of <strong>fusion360</strong>.  </p>
<p>At first, I was afraid of the new, professional software, but with the encouragement from Antti, Diep, and Behnaz, I calmed down, watched Neil&rsquo;s intro video, youtube tutorials, and some Chinese geeks&rsquo; clips.  </p>
<p>After a good sleep, I opened fusion360, randomly drew a pentagon, tried some constraints, clicked here and there to explore the parameter setting window before it accidentally worked!  </p>
<p>I then changed the numeric parameters into mathmatic equations to achieve a better parametric design.  </p>
<p>I also spent several hours understanding the correct way of extruding the shapes.  </p>
<p>The same feeling took place again, which was just like those for Github programming as well as Inkscape. I could literally feel the convenience of parametric design and the reason to use it over Inkscape.  </p>
<p>Mentally, it proved <strong>learning curve</strong> from time to time:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Inkscape-5 days;  </li>
<li>Github very basic programming-12 days;  </li>
<li>Fusion360-7 days.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="observation-and-practice">observation and practice<a class="headerlink" href="#observation-and-practice" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Starting from a basic Inkscape pattern, it is a good habit to add a frame for the convenience of later weeding. Weeding, according to Neil&rsquo;s video, means peeling the unnecessary parts.  </p>
<p>Ctrl + Shift + R can allow me to <strong>resize page to drawing or selection</strong> in Document Properties. 
<img alt="" src="../../images/vp1.jpg" /></p>
<p>To open or close the Roland vinyl cutter, push the handle at the left back side. Then, the two wheels can be lifted.
<img alt="" src="../../images/vp2.1.jpg" /></p>
<p>It is a must to place the vinyl paper between the two wheels. The wheels must also be within the white label ranges in order to be detectable by the machine. The left white wheel defines the starting point of cutting.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/vp2.2.jpg" /></p>
<p>If you want to get a more precise measurement of the vinyl paper, you can press <strong>preference</strong> in printing window, then click &ldquo;<strong>Get from Machine</strong>&rdquo;. This allows the scanner of the vinyl cutter to horizontally run across the vinyl paper. 
<img alt="" src="../../images/vp3.jpg" /></p>
<p>To transfer the .svg file to Roland vinyl cutter, find <strong>Roland CutStudio in Extensions</strong>, then press &ldquo;Open&rdquo;.
<img alt="" src="../../images/vp4.jpg" />
<img alt="" src="../../images/vp5.jpg" /></p>
<p>It is advisable to select &ldquo;<strong>Edge</strong> mode&rdquo; in Sheet category by pressing up/down bottoms. 
<img alt="" src="../../images/vp6.jpg" /></p>
<p>Here we go. A note: the <strong>size</strong> of the vinyl paper should be moderate. Avoid thin one. Importantly, the most obvious difference between vinyl and laser cutter is that vinyl cutter literally uses sharp knife to press on the material to get the lines.
<img alt="" src="../../images/vp7.jpg" />  </p>
<p>You can see the knife cut.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/vp8.jpg" /></p>
<p>The most standarized way to <strong>weed</strong> (peel) the usable sticker is to use tweezer, especially when there are exquisite spots or lines. Of course, if they were just basic patterns, or to make the lessons more attractive to youngsters, fingers and hands are parallelly flexible tools. 
<img alt="" src="../../images/vp9.jpg" /></p>
<p>Transferring sheets are powerful if you want to save the cut work for later use. The tough side of vinyl paper is slippery, allowing transferring sheet to attach them tightly. After this procedure, you can get both the stikers and transferring sheets to show the sticky sides. <span style="color:blue" >Be careful of the dusts, of course.</span>
<img alt="" src="../../images/vp10.jpg" /></p>
<p>This was the end of observation and practice session, which was quite straightforward experience. The frame is an important part to allow convenient weeding. Also, it helps to justify <strong>positive and negative patterns</strong> as soon I encountered when doing my own giant panda printing practice.
<img alt="" src="../../images/vp11.jpg" /></p>
<h3 id="self-design-and-final-work">self design and final work<a class="headerlink" href="#self-design-and-final-work" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>I got a panda bear .svg file from the Internet (the file can be found at the end), added a frame in Inkscape, exported it to Roland Cutstudio, made 3 sizes, then set up the cutter (mode: edge) as in the observation session.
<img alt="" src="../../images/vd1.jpg" /></p>
<p>I used black vinyl as panda bear fur is a combination of white and black. 
<img alt="" src="../../images/vd2.jpg" /></p>
<p>When it came to weeding (peeling), Diep asked about how to define which parts to leave. To be honest, I had the same concern the day before. My friend who knows seal cutting comforted me that it is my justification of positive and negative sides.  </p>
<p>Therefore, you can see that on the left side, the little pattern was the residual that I didn&rsquo;t need simply because I knew the color distribution of panda.  </p>
<p>Also, the larger the sticker is (my largest size was 70mm), the easier to weed and to allow more complicated line designs.
<img alt="" src="../../images/vd3.jpg" /></p>
<p>After weeding, I used transfering sheet. I pressed it hard to the work, then lifted and got the usable stickers.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/vd4.jpg" /></p>
<p>The final work looks great. The sticky side was quite strong. Also, the rough side seems durable (after 3 weeks they are still tough).  </p>

<p>No matter how beautiful the design is, to get the laser cutting started, Behnaz showed us the safety issues that everyone should be serious about: </p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color:red">NEVER LET THE LASER CUTTING WORK ALONE. ALWAYS KEEP AN EYE ON IT. </span>  </li>
</ol>
<p>Luckily, FabLab Oulu installed a separate sensor to detect whether there are people within 2 meters when the laser cutting is on.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/lcp18.jpg" /> </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To turn on the laser printer: turn the round pääkytkin (headswitch) from 0 to 1 (This is to open the vacuum cleaner to inhale the hazardous combustion)→ turn the red handle to the air inside of the cutter flow (it is crucial as the air can be blown out just next to the laser beam shooter and blows away the combustion to be &ldquo;welcomed&rdquo; by the vacuum cleaner. You can hear the noise). → Turn on the power switch of the machine. 
<img alt="" src="../../images/lcp1.jpg" />
<img alt="" src="../../images/lcp2.jpg" />
<img alt="" src="../../images/lcp3.jpg" />  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If something really starts to ignite, <span style="color:red"><strong>number one: stay calm.</strong></span>   </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Number two: <strong>open the laster cutter lid to activate the interlock.</strong> However, if materials like cardboard gets more flames because of the input air, rush to get the nearby <strong>fire blanket to smother the fire</strong>.  </p>
<p>Fire blanket should be the <strong>first priority</strong> because extinguisher is ok but it may create a huge mess to the machine (maybe cost even more to repair afterwards :(), never to say not many people know how to properly use the extinguisher.  </p>
<p>A fire blanket looks like below:
<img alt="" src="../../images/lcp14.jpg" /></p>
<p>Behnaz first introduced us a key concept of laser cutting that is directly related to parametric design: <strong>kerf</strong>.  </p>
<p>Kerf is the material part that <strong>laser beam burns away</strong> (and becomes combustion), which is why laser can &ldquo;cut&rdquo; materials. When we do parametric design with consideration of high precision, <strong>the width of kerf</strong> matters.  </p>
<ul>
<li>For example, I hope to set the pentagon slot width to be <strong>3 mm</strong>. If I simply set the number to be 3 mm, the kerf will make it more than 3mm as it burns slightly more, which can cause instability when interlocking the slots. That was the reason I let set the parameter of &ldquo;slotwidth&rdquo; to be <strong>&ldquo;material thickness - kerf&rdquo;</strong>, instead of assigning a fixed number.  </li>
</ul>
<p>The question comes to: what is the width of <strong>kerf</strong>? Behnaz asked us to laser cut on our own to measure the kerf among different materials.  </p>
<p>This time we used <strong>MDF and acrylic</strong> and see their differences.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/lcp4.jpg" /></p>
<p>It is rather easy to laser cut. There are two steps:  </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Desktop</strong>. Open .svg file in Inkscape → set the line width to be <strong>0.02 mm</strong> → save as <strong>PDF</strong> file → open the PDF file → ctrl + p → examine the Advanced and General windows to set up the printing parameters. → press save and ok  </li>
</ol>
<p>First, save the Inkscape .svg file as PDF file. Open the pdf, click the printing to get the blue window (Epilog Engraver WinX64 Fusion Properties) → Click the Advanced option to choose the preset modes (i.e., In our session, we used 3mm-MDF-engrave+cut and 3mm-acrylic-engrave+cut) → Finalize the setting in General opion.  </p>
<p>300 DPI is fair enough for most cases; <strong>raster</strong> is for <strong>engraving</strong> while <strong>vector</strong> is for <strong>line cutting</strong>.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/lcp5.jpg" /></p>
<p>We also learned the meaning of <strong>DPI</strong>. It stands for &ldquo;<strong>dots per inch</strong>&rdquo;. As each time the laser beam burns a little &ldquo;dot&rdquo; of the surface, when the dpi is 254, the laser beam can surely burn every corner of the inch. In this regard, the preset dpi 300 assumes that there are slightly overlapping burnt parts, which is enough for most engraving work. Otherwise, the surface might be over engraved (burnt like chocolate). 
<img alt="" src="../../images/lcp6.jpg" /> </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Laser Cutter</strong>  Open the lid →  place the cutting material on the working table → set the Focus/Jog → select the Job → Press go → <span style="color:red"> MONITOR THE CUTTING PROCESS AND DON&rsquo;T GO AWAY FOR SAFETY REASONS.</span>  </li>
</ol>
<p>First, open the lid, place the cutting material on the &ldquo;bed&rdquo;, or <strong>working table</strong>. Press it with metal weight if necessary.  </p>
<p>Then, to run the laser cutter, look at the small screen. Use the <strong>joystick</strong> to move up and down to select the functions.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/lcp16.jpg" />  </p>
<p>Do three things in a row:  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Set Focus.</strong> Laser beams are generated, output, then concentrated at the &ldquo;waist&rdquo; point where the power is the strongest. The reason to set the focus is hence to get the &ldquo;beam waist&rdquo;. Since the laser producer tool&rsquo;s height is fixed, you should move up/down the &ldquo;bed&rdquo; to realize the focus setting.  </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>         - Use a **triangular plate** to hang between the two screws of the laser cutting head (see below). It can assist we find the most powerful focus of laser beam of this machine: 2 inches.  
         ![](../images/lcp17.jpg)

         - Turn the joystick left to select the speed (see below). Two arrows means fast, one arrow means slow. Usually you will start from the fast mode. Then turn the joystick up and down to move the working table. When you feel the triangle touches the material, shift it to slow mode to adjust the focus gently.  
         ![](../images/lcp15.jpg)
</code></pre></div>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Set Jog.</strong> This is to set up the beginning point of laser cutting. An red auxiliary beam can assist the setting.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Select the Job.</strong> Use the joystick to choose which laser cutting work your would like to do. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Diep and Antti R measured the MDF kerf (around 0.13mm). Antti J and me measured acrylic kerf. I used the vernier caliper twice. The first result was 0.065 mm, which was biased because I hadn&rsquo;t put the 10 small chips tightly together. When I did it twice, the result was more reasonable: 0.102 mm. In this regard, I could estimate that the kerf for acrylic laser was 0.1mm and set it in the parametric design.
<img alt="" src="../../images/lc6.jpg" />  </p>
<p>(from Diep&rsquo;s measurement)  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../images/lc26.jpg" /></p>
<p>Then, we tested different laser speed and power on MDF to see different effects. The <strong>speed, power and frequency</strong> are the independent variables to control the laser beam results. The beam power is stronger either with slower speed, more power or frequency.
<img alt="" src="../../images/lcp7.jpg" />
<img alt="" src="../../images/lcp8.jpg" /></p>
<p>The results are meaningful: for vector cutting (upper part), the default values worked well, but if the speed was 40 (too fast), the laser could not cut through the MDF.  </p>
<p>Similar result happened if the power was only half (50%). When the speed is defaulted while removing 20% of the power, the vector cut still went well. We estimated that the vector cut on MDF could be effective if the power is above 60%.  </p>
<p>The frequency seemed to have little effect on vector cut (middle). The different raster (lower part) settings had remarkable effects on the engraving results. Even on the same surface, you can set different degrees of raster by changing the power. 
<img alt="" src="../../images/lcp9.jpg" /></p>
<p>We also tested different laser conditions on acrylic. 
<img alt="" src="../../images/lcp10.jpg" /></p>
<p>The results are interesting:  </p>
<p>If the speed is 80% with other settings being defaulted, the laser cannot cut through the acrylic.  </p>
<p>When engraving, if the power is 5, you simply could not see apparent patterns on the surface. We were joking that it might be &ldquo;useful&rdquo; in cheating :)  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/lcp11.jpg" />
<img alt="" src="../../images/lcp12.jpg" /></p>
<p>Then, we tested the effects of different focuses of laser beam.  </p>
<p>The laser beam was most concentrated on the thinnest point, or the &ldquo;<strong>beam waist</strong>&rdquo;, which has the most power. The upper and lower parts are like a sand clock. The results were not so obvious by appearance, but if I touched the engraved surfaces, the focused one was indeed tougher than others. 
<img alt="" src="../../images/lcp13.jpg" /></p>
<p>Last, Behnaz introduced us a smaller laser printer in Oulu FabLab. It does not need extra setup for <strong>focus</strong>, but requires more manual work to install the air tube to a electric fan.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/lcp19.jpg" />
<img alt="" src="../../images/lcp20.jpg" />  </p>
<p>The setup of the smaller printer is rather straightforward: turn on the switch and connect it to the preset laptop.<br />
<img alt="" src="../../images/lcp21.jpg" />
<img alt="" src="../../images/lcp22.jpg" /></p>
<p>Behnaz guided us to see what different DPI sets were look like in this printer.  </p>
<p>In fact, I was more secured to realize the same blue window of Epilog, as it meant that I could use existing skills to change parameters. It was also a good review of <strong>vector</strong>, <strong>raster</strong>, <strong>DPI</strong>, as well as the preset parameters in Advanced window. 
<img alt="" src="../../images/lcp23.jpg" />  </p>
<p>We tested 3 DPI settings: 150, 300(default), 600. The result was as below:  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/lcp24.jpg" />  </p>
<p>As DPI number increases, the &ldquo;resolution&rdquo; also goes up, which makes laser beam burn more intensively on the material surface, resulting in a darker engraving pattern.  </p>
<h3 id="self-design-and-final-work_1">self design and final work<a class="headerlink" href="#self-design-and-final-work_1" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>I really appreciate Behnaz to help me understand the meaning of those formats. Also thanks Antti R to help me with the codes for hyperlink in Github. </p>
<p>I met some problems using Fusion360 at the begining of the week mostly because I felt hesitant and scared of new software. I was anxious about the functions or unfamiliar keyboard combinations of Fusion360, just like when I started to programme at CMD, Inkscape, or generally speaking, anything new including some classic RPGs such as Neverwinter Night, the Elder Scroll, etc. or living in a new country. It is more about personality. So, I tried to dodge Fusion360, but when it came to Behnaz&rsquo;s week for computer-controlled cutting, I must face it as Inkscape is smart except for one thing: <span style="color:red">parametric design!</span>  </p>
<p>After hours of nervous attempt, I practised designing a pentagon with slots.  </p>
<p>First, I randomly drew a pentagon under the menu of <strong>sketch + create</strong>. Then I clicked <strong>polygon - circumscribed polygon</strong> (actually the three selections are just different ways to define a polygon). It does not matter which side in the space to be the 2D canva.   </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/fp20.jpg" />  </p>
<p>It did not have to be accurate for the size of the polygon as later I could use parameteric designs to constrain the key numbers.  </p>
<p>While dragging the shape on the canva, I moved the mouse to left change the edge into 5.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/fp21.jpg" />  </p>
<p>After this, I could get a raw, unparametrically constrained <strong>pentagon</strong>.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/fp1.jpg" /></p>
<p>Now comes to the parametric design, which Neil, Yrjo, Behnaz as well as numerous vtubers emphasized.  </p>
<p>The logic is rather simple: Instead of setting key numbers (side length, angle, etc.) by hand for endless times in complicated design, parametric design allows you to <strong>define certain sides, lengths, angles, and into parameters</strong>. <span style="color:green"> The parameters can be numbers, or mathmatic equations.</span> It is powerful as when you change some factors, e.g. the customers hope to have different sizes of the product, everything will be automatically and smartly reset <strong>which cannot be achieved by Inkscape but Fusion360.</strong></p>
<p>Instead of setting parameters by hand for endless times in complicated design, you can just <strong>define certain parameters with their expressions (length, angle, etc.)</strong>. So I clicked the <strong>part + sketch</strong> (the radial menu reminds me of the counterpart in Neverwinter Nights). It was chunky at first, but useful after getting used to it.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/nwnradialmenu.jpg" /></p>
<p>For example, for the pendagon, I named each side as &ldquo;side&rdquo;. I also named a <strong>kerf</strong> (measured as 0.1 mm in previous observation), the material thickness (expressed as <strong>mdfthickness</strong>) in 3 mm (MDF board). The rest parameters were thus defined as:  </p>
<ul>
<li>slot width(expressed as <strong>slotwidth</strong>): mdfthickness - kerf  </li>
<li>halfside: (side-slotwidth)/2  </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/fp16.jpg" /></p>
<p>As a test, I modified the kerf into 0.3mm, then the other related parameters were immediately reset.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/fp17.jpg" /> </p>
<p>Returned to the original design, the &ldquo;slotwidth&rdquo; is still 2.9mm, but <strong>defined by equations</strong>; The &ldquo;halfside&rdquo; was also smartly reset:)
<img alt="" src="../../images/fp18.jpg" /></p>
<hr />
<hr />
<p>The next step was to export the design as a printable pdf.  </p>
<p>I thought things would be quite easy and straightforward (<strong>extrude → set a number of thickness → generate a new drawing from the design</strong>). However, I was so naive, which ultimately made me refine and reflect on the trouble that I wanted to dodge.  </p>
<p>At the beinning, as the picture below, I found it a bit strange with unconnected lines.
<img alt="" src="../../images/f360eplp1.jpg" /></p>
<p>I clicked the drawing view settings and found that the lines were connected if I changed the scale in to <strong>1:2</strong>. Then I happily exported it into pdf format.
<img alt="" src="../../images/f360eplp2.jpg" /></p>
<p>When I inspected the pdf file in Inkscape of the Oulu FabLab desktop, I found the problem: ok, <strong>everything was shrunk into half size including the slot.</strong> Apparently, I could not use a slot with 1.5 mm in MDF as the thickness was 3 mm.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/f360eplp3.jpg" /></p>
<p>As time was very limited, I needed to hand in some tentative assignments on time, I directly used Inkscape to close the 1:1 scale pentagon lines through drawing.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/f360eplp4.jpg" /></p>
<p>Then, I selected all the lines to set the width to be <strong>0.02 mm</strong> for laser cutting (not graving).  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/f360eplp5.jpg" /></p>
<p>I observed that the laser cutting work ran twice: first to cut the unconnected lines, then pinpointedly cut the modified parts from Inkscape, which proved its smartness in 2D design. 
<img alt="" src="../../images/f360eplp6.jpg" /></p>
<p>I duplicated the pentagon to get 5 extra pieces.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/f360eplp7.jpg" /></p>
<p>After waiting for 1 minute, I took out the pieces. Before playing, I used the vernier caliper to measure the side and slot. The results were satisfactory: side-53mm; slotwidth-0.3mm (0.1mm&rsquo;s credit for kerf).
<img alt="" src="../../images/f360eplp8.jpg" />
<img alt="" src="../../images/f360eplp9.jpg" /></p>
<p>Finally I could play the pieces by putting them together. It looked stable and nice.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/f360eplp10.jpg" /></p>
<p>I particularly checked the interlocking part: since the slothdepth was 0.5 mm, the total interlock depth was 1.0 mm. It was fairly stable, but would be better If I made the slotwidth deeper, say, 1 mm.  </p>
<p>Also, the nodes and other interlocking designs are all worth exploring.  </p>
<p>Behnaz also found that among the five slots, some of them were more stable than others, which may be the differences between horizontal and diagonal laser beam traces.  </p>
<p>As for the function, pentagon looks elegant, so I would use Inkscape to draw some patterns or pictures and use it as a badge. The wizard card in Harry Potter is a good example.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/hpwc.jpg" /></p>
<hr />
<hr />
<p>I still wanted to &ldquo;close&rdquo; the disconnected lines. Behnaz explained how the function of extrude works, which opened a great DLC of the week&rsquo;s project and occupied all my free time in 2022 lunar new year, which unexpectedly made me learn something new.  </p>
<p>I clicked the pentagon, extruded with 3mm (to match the MDF thickness), got a 3D object, and thought everything was ok.  </p>
<p>However, the lines were still not connected in the drawing, which drove me confused at night.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/f360eplp11.jpg" />
<img alt="" src="../../images/f360eplp12.jpg" />
<img alt="" src="../../images/f360eplp13.jpg" /></p>
<p>I consulted Diep. She calmed me down then helped me through remote screen sharing. She suspected that I hadn&rsquo;t selected the whole shape but only the frame whose extruded version had not covered the whole design.  </p>
<p>I tried again by drawing and extruding a new pentagon. This time the whole shape was selected.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/f360eplp14.jpg" /></p>
<p>Then, I created a drawing and ok, scale 1:1, lines connected. At least it was clear that the lines could only be closed as long as <strong>the object is extruded on a surface rather than the frame.</strong>  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/f360eplp15.jpg" /></p>
<p>This time I was stuck because no matter how I changed the &ldquo;select&rdquo;, the pentagon with slots was like a hollow ghost which was too naughty or transparent to be captured. I nearly gave up until I clicked the <strong>&ldquo;surface&rdquo; and added a &ldquo;patch&rdquo;</strong> to forcely create a surface within the shape.  </p>
<p>It seemed successful.
<img alt="" src="../../images/f360eplp16.jpg" /></p>
<p>As the direction was reversed, I set the extrude parameter to be -3 mm.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/f360eplp17.jpg" /></p>
<p>It worked in a rather weird way&hellip;  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/f360eplp18.jpg" /></p>
<p>I created a drawing and finally got a proper work even though the procedure was not the optimal. This was the most meaningful, diligent and hard working lunar new year so far in my life.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/f360eplp19.jpg" />  </p>
<p>What I learned most from this week is that no matter how difficult the tasks might be, there will be multiple solutions.  </p>
<p>Also, if a software looks chunky and monstrous at the beginning, it is usually because of the abundance of functions and super convenience to solve specific issues. Unlike &ldquo;user friendly&rdquo; Excel and Word (they are easy to start but quite professional and powerful at the end), it is just the contrary way to reach suitable users. </p>
<p>Behnaz shared a small tip I found quite useful nowadays: When it is stuck, close and reopen.  </p>
