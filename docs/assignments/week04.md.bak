# 4. Computer controlled cutting

This week Behnaz taught us how to use vinyl cutter and laser cutter. To get a svg file, the simplest way is to practise using Inkscape. This time, I had to force myself to use Fusion 360 to do parametric design before transfering it to an svg file. Fusion 360 is inescapable as Inkscape is powerful only except for parametric design. 


## Research
The toughest part was the usage of fusion360. At first, I was afraid of the new, professional software but with the encouragement from Antti, Diep, and Behnaz, I calmed down, watched Neil's intro video, youtube tutorials, and some Chinese geeks' clips. After a good sleep, I opened fusion360, randomly drew a pentagon, tried some constraints, clicked here and there to explore the parameter setting window before it accidentally worked! The same feeling took place again, which was just like those for Github programming as well as Inkscape. I could literally feel the convenience of parametric design and the reason to use it over Inkscape. Mentally, it proved learning curve again: For me, Inkscape-5 days; Github programming-12 days; Fusion360-7 days.

Starting from a basic Inkscape pattern, it is a good habit to also draw a frame for the convenience of later weeding. Weeding, according to Neil's video, means peeling the unnecessary parts. Ctrl + Shift + R can allow me to resize page to drawing or selection in Document Properties.

To open or close the Roland vinyl cutter, push the handle at the left back side. Then, the two wheels can be lifted.

It is a must to place the vinyl paper between the two wheels. The wheels must also be within the white label ranges to be detectable by the machine.
